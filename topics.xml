	<text> ANOTHER NEW ELEMENT
Three French chemists — M. and
Mme. Curie and M. Bemont — have dis
covered a new metallic element, which
they call "radium," because of its 
remarkable property of emitting rays
which resemble in their penetrative
power Prof. Roentgen's celebrated X
rays. Not long ago much surprise was
caused by the discovery that uranium
is capable of emitting similar rays, but
the power of radium in this respect is
said to be 900 times greater than that
of uranium.

	<text> THE CATHODE RAY OUTDONE
  WHEN the marvels of the cathode or X ray
were made known to the world only a few
years ago, it was believed we had reached a
degree of photographic power that would not be sur
passed for generations to come, and that for the use
of surgeons in locating foreign substances imbedded
in flesh or bone it would be of permanent value. Yet
according to reports of experiments made by Pro
fessor Barker in Philadelphia a short time ago, that
wonderful ray is about to become a back number be
cause of the potency shown by a newly discovered
element known as "radium."
The discovery of the new element is due to M. and
lime. Curie and is the result of investigations stimu
lated by the discovery of the X-ray. They were ex
perimenting in 1898 with uranium and its salts, which
exert a feeble photographic power, when they ob
served phenomena indicating the existence of an un
known factor in the mass. They at once directed
their investigations to the separation of that element
from the substances with which it was associated
and found not one but two new elements. To the first
they gave the name "polonium" and to the second
'•radium." The first is believed to have a radiant
power five hundredfold greater than that of uranium,
but Professor Barker estimates the efficiency of ra
dium at one hundred thousand times that of uranium.
For this reason and because of its comparative cheap
ness and simplicity the second of the Curies' discov
eries seems destined, it is said, to replace the costly
and complicated X-ray apparatus in the realm of sur
gery.
The most extraordinary characteristic of the new
element is thus described in an account of Professor
Barker's experiments by the New York Tribune:
"The practicability of deriving one form of energy
heat, light, electricity or chemical action— from
some other has long been recognized, but it is axiom
atic that none of them can be produced except by that
method. It is believed that the most man can do is
to transform. It is thought that he cannot, in any
true sense, create. Roentgen obtained his X-rays
only by a conversion of force previously existing in
the form of electricity. But a radiance which will
penetrate opaque bodies and act upon the chemicals
on a photographic plate is secured from radium with
out the apparent use of any known species of energy.
The phenomenon may yet be explained. But at pres
ent it looks very much like what has long been re
garded an impossibility, the spontaneous generation
of force."
The discovery of unknown elements of such mar
velous potencies at this late stage in the investigations
of science is a striking proof of how little we know
of the substances that lie around us or of the forces
that act upon them. There is no telling wlrit wide
and high uses may yet be made of radium, but it is
probable the discovery will be one of the most im
portant gifts which this century v:ill bestow for the
guidance of science in that which is to come

to Mme. Marie Sklodowska Curie of the
University of Paris.
Mme. Curie is the chief professor of
sciences in the University of Paris. She
was the discoverer, with her husband.
Prof. Pierre Curie, of radium, and in
1903 shared with him half of the Xobel
pflze for physics, the other half being
awarded to Prof. Antoine Henri Bec

awarded annually amounts to $40,000.
Recent announcement was made of
the success of Mme. Curie in producing
polonium, "a new element possessing a
radio activity superior to radium."

"But be ye doers of the word,

This writer sends one hundred
dollars to the "Marie Curie Ra

There should be a thousand men
in the United States eager to send
each one hundred dollars to such
a fund, and to each will occur the
name of some good American
woman in whose honor the money
could be sent and thus made ac
captable. There follow some facts
about Madame Curie.
Dr. Ladislas Sklodowski, profes
r afhysics at Warsaw, mqrried
a Boguska, principal of
os rn school.
November 7,. 1i-p, hir
dawghter was borfi. She grew up
in her father's laboratory, looking
after his too tubes,.urucibles,an
0tberap(fatUs from the time she
wa afx years old.
At sixteen Marie Sklodowski,
now Marie Curie, was graduated
irm the -Girls' Gymnasium, re
esiving a medal of gold. She was
then a well-educated scientist.
Next she worked in the physics
liboratory of the Industrial Mu
asina in Warsaw.
On her father's death she went
to Paris to continue her scientific
studies. On an income of $20 a
month she lived alone in one small
seem, her furniture an iron bed
and one chair, her diet black bread
and milk.
She found work in a scientific
laboratory as a washer of bottles
and continued her studies. Pro
fessor Lipp n, observing her
ability, enabled her to obtain a
free course in physics, chemistry,
and mathematics at the Sorbonne,
where she now lectures and teaches,
the first woman tco be thus hon
gred.
You have heard "proud man"

It would do such men good to fol

up t her discovery of radium, a

Prof. Pierre Curie, but due chiefly
to her.
Everybody knew that salts of

fessor Becquerel. Madame Curie
and her husband learned that
pitch-blende also produces radio
active force that will pass through
any substance, lead and steel ex
That vague information satisfied
others, but Madame Curie was de
termined to know just WHAT it
was that caused the radioactivity.
Por three years she worked stead
ily, intensely, using In experiments
every penny above the actual cost
of keeping herself alive. In her
work she "reduced" tons of pitch
blende.
At last, In 1900, in Paris, a
watchease was exhibited contain
ing a speck of the world's rarest,
most extraordinary element. It
was labeled "Radium-Discovered
by Madame Curie."
.In 1911 Madame Curie obtained
the Nobel Prise for chemistry.
When her husband was killed in
1906 there was no one able to take
his place at the Sorbonne, except
his wife, and that ancient Institu

	<text>IMMORTAL WOMAN
The visit of Madam Marie Curie to this country in May
will be celebrated by American women with the presentation
of a thimbleful of radium to the distinguished scientist. At was
a beautiful tribute to the modesty of womankind that Mine.
Curie made when she discovered the element which has revo-
lutionized physics, chemistry and some branches of medicine,
and gave it an impersonal name. The courtesy of the labora-
-tory dictates that the discoverer of a new thing under the sun
may give it his own name if he wishes, and so perpetuate nia
own glory. Mme. Curie called it radium, because it gives out
HINTS TO GARDENERS
More than sentiment attaches to the gift. Of course, it
money value, something like $100,000, will have little weight
with a devotee of science like Mme. Curie.: She will use the
radium for scientific research. Although Mme. Curie knows
more concerning radium and its potentialities than any living
soul, she has not, because of her generosity, one grain with
which to conduct experiments.
The history of the discovery of radium is one of the most
exalted romances that the world has ever known. The daugh-
ter of a professor in the University of Warsaw, the present Mme.
Curie was drawn to Paris by the magnetic pull of the renowned
scientific schools there. In conjunction with the scientists
Becquerel and Curie, she began a series of experiments with
uranium which led to her discovery of radium. It also led to
her happy marriage with Professor Curie. That the discovery
was that of Mme. Curie alone was well established by a com-
mission which awarded her the Nobel prize in 1903.
The hope which radium holds out to the world is that it
may be the means of fighting cancer, that malignant disease
which has baffled physicians for centuries. Undoubtedly there
are new fields into which researchers can go. And it is in these
unexplored regions that Mme. Curie will venture. The women
of America honor themselves by providing the means.

  The Human Side of the News
Mme. Curie Was Martyr to Science
By Edwin C. Hill
Two arresting facts spring
instantly from the passing of
that noble woman, Mme.
Marie Curie. The first was
that she was permitted to live
and die in poverty. The sec
ond was that she was a martyr
to her own scientific labors. If
the head of the hospital in
which she got through with
life is to be believed, she was
killed by the very mysterious
element she, herself, discovered
—radium.
We learn that her only
means of support consisted of
a grant of $2,500 a year from
the French government, surely
not a princely pension! The
woman who brought great glory
to France was rewarded with
a pittance, and even this pit
tance she spent mostly in her
scientific researches. She knew
that radium was killing her—
so at least, says the physician
who treated her—but refused
to give up, treating her life
as of no importance compared
to the possibility of some fasci
nating discovery in her chosen
field of physics.
Great Scientist
And now she will lie in the
Pantheon, with her husband.
Pierre, peaceful and happy for
the first time in 30 years; for
the first time since her young
husband stepped out into the
street to have his life crushed
out by a passing vehicle.
Mme. Curie belonged among
the 10 greatest scientists of the
world. She was the number one
woman of her generation. Even
' at 67. little, white-haired Marie
Curie, clad in her neat, straight,
tailored suit of black, with white
blouse and black four-in-hand
tie knotted close to her slender
throat, worked 12 hours a day,
patiently delving into the mys
tery of life.
She was not a French woman
born, for she was born in War
saw, Poland. Her amazing apti
tude for physics and mathe
matics came from her father,
who was a professor in the Uni
versity of Warsaw. An interest
ing example of the workings of
heredity.
As a young girl she lived in a
Paris garret while she toiled
away at her studies. And one
day, at the home of her pro
fessor, she met a rising French
physicist and chemist named
Pierre Curie.
It was one of those cases of
love at first sight, which sweeps
all obstacles from the path of
lovers. A year later they were
married. Both were as poor as
church mice. They had just
500 francs to the? name. With
a hundred of this combined capi
tal they bought two bicycles
and spent their honeymoon dis
covering the outskirts of Paris.
They lived in a three-room
flat, blissfully happy, and
there the daughter, Irene, was
born. These were the happiest
days of Madame Curie’s life. It
was in 1899 that Pierre and
Madame Curie discovered the
mysterious force which they
named radium.
The Nobel prize in physics
was awarded to them—in fact,
it was awarded twice to her —
and for Madame Curie was
created a special chair in
physics in the Sorbonne, the
great university of Paris.
And three years later came
the tragic blow which robbed
Marie Curie of her happiness.
Pierre was killed by a truck
as he started to cross a street
—a terrible stroke of fate to
this woman who was both a
distinguished scientist and a
loving wife and mother.
Mme. Curie paid two visits
to the United States, the first
in 1921 to receive a gram of
radium purchased for her by
the women of this country for
SIOO,OOO, and the second time in
1929 to receive a second gram.
In the eight years intervening,
her work had developed econo
mies in production that reduced
the cost of a gram to $50,000.
Upon this latter occasion, she
was received at the White House
by President Hoover.
Dreary Days
She disliked romanticizing,
either her life or the dreary
days which she spent in patient
research with her husband. Os
those years, Paul Appell, presi
dent of the Academy of Paris,
wrote as follows:
“M. and Mme. Curie, not being
able to pursue their chemical ex
periments in a school room
which had been placed at their
disposal, arranged for these in
a sort of abandoned warehouse
opposite their atelier. In this
place, with its asphalt floor, its
broken and patched glass roof,
hot in summer, heated by a cast
iron stove in winter, they per
formed their wonderful work.
The equipment consisted of some
old and worn deal tables, upon
which Mme. Curie prepared the
material for the production of
radium.
The time has not yet come to
measure the importance of
Marie Curie’s principal dis
covery. Will radium or some
adaptation of its use eventually
end one of the greatest scourges
of humanity, cancer?

Eminent Woman Chemist Prin

.Faffs, Dae. 14.—The name of Mine.
Curie, the discoverer of radium and
one of the moat eminent professors of
chemistry at the college of France,
was cited in a petition filed in the di
vorce court by the wife of Professor
Tjangevin, also a professor of general
and experimental physics at the col
lege of France.
Mme. Lattgevin asks in her petition
for separation and possession of her
children. She also claimed separate
maintenance on the ground of her
husband's alleged misconduct. Both
of the parties submitted their conclu
sions to the court. Maitre Coudy,
who Is Mme. Langevin's lawyer, sub
mitted also a number of documents
containing letters alleged to have
passed between Mme. Curie and Pro
fessor Langevin, which he contends,
prove 'grave injuries," this term
meaning either physical violence or
marital infldolky.

Bnuona Tor Believing that the Planet is
Inhabited.
The conditions which favor the blief
in the existence of life in the planet
Mars present the clearest possible evi
dence ot being one in origin and structure
with our own earth. We cannot tell
wnat the nature of the soil of Mars may
be, but its generally ruddy tince so
well marked that, though the telescope
shows an almost equal part of the surface
to be greenish in hue, the red prevails,
giving to the planet, as seen by the naked
eye, its obvious red color eee'ms to show
that it resembles the red sandstone of
our own earth. This, we know, is one of
tne oiaer geological tormations, and if we
could safely compare terrestrial with
Martian geology, or, let us say, geology
with aerology, we might almost be
tempted to find in the present prevalence
of a tint belonging to one of the earlier
of our terrestrial formation an argument
in favor of the theory that Mars passed
through fewer stages of development
during its life bearing condition than
on r earth, and that thus the later forma
tions of our earth's surface are wanting
in the surface of Mars. This reasoning
would not be very safe, however, it im
plies a resemblance in details which is
not likely, the observed rule of nature
seeming so far as we can judge, to be
similarity in generals, variety in details.
We may well believe that the ruddiness
of the soil of Mars is due to the same
general cause as the ruddiness of our
red sandstone the general prevalence of
certain organisms but neither the actual
character of this particular formation,
nor its position in the territorial series of
strata can be safely predicted of the
ruddy formation constituting the chief
part of the visible land surface of Mars.
Few will now suppose with a French
writer that the ruddiness of Mars is due
to the color of the vegetation there. A
certain support is given to the idea by.
the circumstance that the degree ot rud
diness is variable, and is somewhat
greater during the Martain summer than
in spring and autumn. In this sense we
may say of the summer of Mars with the
poet Wendell Holmes :
The snows that glittered on the disc of Mars
Have melted, and the planet's fiery ob
Bolls in the crimson summer of its year.
But the ruddiness of the planet's sum
mer which will be well marked this
year, for on September 18, only eleven
days after its time of nearest approach
and greatest splendor, it will be mid
summer's day lor the southern half of
Mara can be otherwise and better ex
plained than by supposing that the
Martian forests glow with fiery foliage
during the summer days. We can see,
as the summer proceeds, the white mists
which had hidden the planet's lands and
seas breaking up, and the features of the
surface being gradually revealed with
more and more distinctness. It is to the
disappearance of these mists and clouds,
not to the red leaves of Martian trees,
that the change in the plant's color must
most probably be referred. We have less
reason for doubt as to the nature of the
greenish markings. The spectroscope, as
we have already explained in "Life in
Mars," shows that the air of Mars is at
times laden heavily with the vapor of
water. We can no longer, therefore,
follow Wbewell in doubting the real na
ture of the green parts of the planet, or
refuse with him to accept explanation of
the white polar marking long since ad
vanced by Sir W. Herschel. Undoubt
edly wide seas and oceans, with many
straits and bays and inland seas, exist on
Mars. Snow and ice gather in the win
ter time about his polar regions, dimin
ishing gradually in extent as summer
proceeds, but never entirely disappearing.
Thus we are not left doubtful as to the
general resemblance of Mars, so tar as the
structure of his surface is concerned, to
the earth on which we live. He has a
surface of earth, probably in large part
formed by deposition at the bottom of
former seas and subsequently raised
above the sea level by subterranean forces,
or rather caused to appear above the
surface by the effects of the gradual
shrinkage of the planet's crust. Cornhill
Magazine.

	<text>Again, if we are right in supposing the
currents of air in Mars to be of more than
usual violence, while the solidifying force
of friction which resists them is much
smaller than here, it may be a reasonable
inference that " natural selection" has al
ready weeded out the loftier growing trees,
which would stand less chance in encount
ers with hurricanes than our own ; and it
is not improbable that the tendency of the
greater facilities for motion, and the great
er velocity of life in Mars altogether,
would be that all its animal inhabitants
range wider for their food, and obtain less
on a given area than on our earth.
We should be disposed to conjecture
that it is a world in which speed is greater
and of more importance than even on the
earth ; and, if so, it seems likely enough
that the difficulty we have supposed as to
the solidity of walls exposed to the atmos
pheric currents of Mars is got over as the
difficulty of building durable structures is
generally got over in our own tropics,
where earthquakes are so common by not
building durable structures at all, but only
very light and fragile ones a process
which would, of course, be much easier
where all the materials were lighter and
all motion swifter than with us. In a
word, it seems likely that the distinctive
feature of life on Mars is velocity; that
the creatures there live faster, move often
er, undergo more change just as the
planet itself passes through a far vaster
orbit (though its orbital velocity is not
quite so great as ours) in one of the
Martial years. But that such a character
istic would tend to quicken the progress
of the mind and of discovery is doubtfuL
With us civilization has never advanced
rapidly till it had become tame and, so to
say, plodding, and the excitements of local
change, at least, had become few. But
the great seasonal changes of Mars es
pecially in the southern hemisphere, where
the winter and summer are aggravated by
the enormously increased distance of the
sun at that period when his rays are least
direct, and his nearness at that period
when his rays are most direct contribute
to confirm the impression we have drawn
from other considerations that physically.
at least, the lite tnere nas lar more oi
rapid change in it than we can easily con
ceive ; but whether that has developed or
arrested the mental and moral progress of
the Martialists is a question of which the
elements are altogether too conjectural for
serious discussion. London Spectator. .

	<text>PLANET mars and its hen
jocb Discussion as to tbe Lights and
Marks on the Planet.
^semblances Between Mars and Earth
_We Cannot Tell Tet About the
Men Theré.
Are the people on the planet
Mars trying to signal the earth?
That is the question which the
work of the great Lick telescope
during the past few days has
aroused, as Mars has approached
nearer and nearer to the big Cali
fornia instrument, wTiich will soon
have opportunities for observation
sueh as were never known before
in the history of astronomy.
This may be the explanation of
the Btrange phenomena observed
this week at the Lick observatory.
The results thus far obtained have
already been so extraordinary as
to have made profound impression
upon the practical minds of the
astronomers there assembled.
Three great lights, forming a tri
angle, have been seen in the south
western limb of the planet. They
had never been seen before, in any
observations.
There was no mistake about
these lights. They were seen for
four nights in succession, so that it
was impossible that they could
have been produced by conditions
of the earthly or Martian atmos
pheres or have been optical delu
eions ot any kind. Wnen first
seen at the Lick observatory, these
lights in a triangle so astonished
the astonomers that they believed
them to be the effect of light uncon
nected with the planet. They
therefore, with true astronomical
caution, waited until the following
night before devoting much thought
to the lights. On the second night,
however, which was even more
clear and brilliant than the first,
the lights were Been to be there
when the great polished lens was
turned upon the orb which had
itepped to its place in the sky.
For two succeeding evenings
after that these lights were ob
served, burning steadily, brilliantly
and effulgently, as if from three
mountain tops. It was evident
that the lights were placed upon
mountains in Mars or artificial
projections or elevations of some
kind.
The appearance of three brilliant
lights in a triangle upon one of tbe
plaiiets in a manner the astrono
mers are unable to explain raises a
presumption at which their minds
recoil. A scientist would, when
thoroughly convinced of the exist
ence of these light under such con
ditions as are known to prevail in
Mars, easily glide to the almost
irresistible conclusion that they
were the work of the men on
MarB.
Observed at any other time
there would be apparently no other
mean of explaining these lights in a
way satisfactory to common sense
Observed at the present time, whon
eminent men in science have
reached the conclusion that the
people on Mars would seize tho
opportunity to try again to attract
the attention of people on the earth
the three lights on Mars are as
significant as the moving lights in
the diBtanco were to Columbus on
his caravel.
Hut tho the three strange lights
which have looked down tho 3b
incli tube of the Lick telescope for
four successive nights and astound
ed the astronomers at the other end
art- not the only unusual appear
ances upon the surface of the
planet which the great piece of
Hint glass has revealed. That
glass, which cost over $50,000 and
at
took years to select, grind and
polish until perfection was attained,
has re waled things which other
observatories have not noticed dur
ing the present opposition.
The people of Mars being able to
bridge this globe which we call
Earth so close to them that they
can see forests, fields and cities, if
indeed, they cannot actually see
people walking on the streets,
would be eager to establish com
munication with us. They may
have tried to do this for centuties
at each recurring opposition of
Mars, or opposition of the Earth,
as they would call it, and repeated
failures would only stir them to
greater efforts.
The light» suddenly went out,
though, at different times of the
four nights when they were seen.
It almost seemed as if they were
supplied by an electric current and
as if the current had been shut off,
so suddenly did they disappear.
Amazement struck the observers
when first the lights went out.
They reflected that, of course, the
lights were some atmospheric effect
on the rim of Mar* and the very
fact of their strange disappearance
tended to prove this. The next
night, however, the three Btrange
lights flashed out in the same
place as soon as darkness had set
in and after showing steadily for a
few hours they vanished.
SchiaparelU was the first person
to give definite basis upon which
to rest the belief that Mars was
inhabited by a highly civilized
race. He discovered that the sur
face of the planet was intersected
by a large number of canals.
Primarily, Flammarion based
his theory upon that of Schiaparelli
and the two run in together in
many places, being to a large ex
tent identical. He showed plainly
that there was water upon the
planet, and there was little doubt,
he said, that the inhabitants of
Mars very closely resembled those
ot the earth.
Thus, in considering the subject
of opening up communication with
the Martians Flammarion has de
voted much thought to a possible
method of signals which might be
devised upon the earth. He has
said: "A triangle, traced in lumi
nous lines on MarB* surface, each
side from twelve to fifteen kilome
tres long, would be visible from
here by the aid of our telescopes.
It follows then that a triangle,
square or circle of the dimen
sions stated, constructed upon
a vast plain of the earth by
means of luminous points, reflected
in the daytime by solar light and
ligted at night by electicity, would
be visible to the astronomers of
Mars if there are such astronomers
and if they have optical instruments
as good as our own.
Tracing this illustration still fur
ther, Flammarion has said:
"The logical sequence is simple.
If we were to see a triangle con
structed on Mars we would be con
siderably puzzled, but if we were
to see it change first into a square
and then into a circle we would
think with some reason that such
figures reveal without question the
presence of a geometrician upon
the neighbor world. The question
however, now arises, what object
our brethren could have in forming
these figures. Why Bhould not the
inhabitants of Mars be as curious
as we are, more intelligent perhaps,
more elevated in their aspirations,
less hampered than we are in the
mire of material needs? Why
should they not suppose that the
earth is inhabited as well a» their
own world, and why should not the
object of these geometrical appeals
be to ask ub whethes whether we
exist? It is not difficult to reply.
They show us a triangle; we pro
duce it here. They trace a circle;
imitate it, and lo! communication
is established.

	<text>THE MARTIAN FORESTS
VERIFIED BY OBSERVATIONS AT
THE LOWELL OBSERVATORY.
Remarkable Evidence of the Passase
of tbe Seaoni, Foliase Changing
from Green to Yellovr.
Flagstaff (Ariz.) Letter in New York
Herald.
Since our communication to the Herald
regarding the doubling of the Ganges, two
other canals on Mars have begun to show
double the Phison and the Euphrates. The
importance of this observation lies in the
fact that such duplication was precisely
what theory led us to expect would occur.
It is six weeks since the Ganges showed
double at a time and in a manner parallel
ing its appearances at the last apposition.
The Phison and Euphrates are now in HXe
manner counterpartlng their behavior of
two years ago.
Nor is this all. The surface of the planet,
both in the light and the dark regions is
undergoing the same metamorphosis It did
then. In other words, the seasonal changes
observed in the last Martian year are re
peating themselves in this one. That these
seasonal changes are the effect of vegeta
tion upon the planet we showed then to be
almost certainly the fact. The observations
of this year help to confirm our deduction.
The seasonal history of the two succes
sive Martian years thus paralleling itself
Is in detail most interesting to witness. Wre
will begin with the behavior of the Syrtis
Major and then pass on to that of the
double canals. The Syrtis Major is the
most important of the dark areas on the
planet. It ia a curious funnel-shaped mark
ing, large toward the south, and contract
ing steadily northward till It comes to an
end in two canals that curve respectively
east and west away from it, forming the
Astapus and the Nilosyrtis.
It Is historically of great interest, because
it was the first marking Identified with cer
tainty on the planet by Huygens, in 1659,
and by its identification first enabled the
planet's rotation period to be found. It
was then and long afterward believed to
be a great sea or ocean, Its blue-green col
or seeming to render this a most probable
supposition. More minute examination has
now, as we have said, rendered It practi
cally certain that it Is, in fact, not an
ocean at all, but the largest fertile region
on the planet's surface, its blue-green hue
being due to vegetation, leaves and trasses,
or whatever relatives of such may consti
tute the Martian flora.
The following account of its successive
appearances will show the reader the rea
sons upon which this deduction of its char
acter is based. Early in the Martian year
the planet's southern hemisphere, the Syr
tis Major, and the great contiguous dark
area, under the same name, to the south,
and now more commonly known as the
Tyrrhenium, presents the appearance of one
nearly uniform blue green surface. The
only discernible diversities in it are the
deeper tint of its northern end, the com
paratively narrow neck of the funnel and
of two long bands which join it to the polar
sea, traversing about sixty degrees of lati
tude in order to do so. These bands are of
a deeper color than the rest of the region,
but not so dark aa the bottom of the Syrtis
itself.
THE SEASONS ON MARS.
Such is the appearance during the spring
months, and such it continues to be into
what corresponds In the Martian calendar
to our May and June. After the summer
solstice of the Martian southern hemi
sphere, when the season passes from its
June into its July, the extreme southern
parts of the dark area fade and turn stead
ily from a deep blue green to a fainter one
and then into an orange ochre.
Shortly after this there appears in the
Syrtis Major itself strange mottllngs, Curi
ous causewaylike appearances and rhom
boidal areas of a perceptibly lighter tint
than their surroundings. These then change
further from a faint blue green to an
orange ochre, just as happened before in
the parts of the surface further south.
These causeways, as we may designate
them tor distinction, are very singular
looking marks indeed. They stretch from
the so-called continental bright areas of
the planet over to the so-called islands to
the south, and look precisely as if they
were actual causeways connecting the two.
There are a great many of them all around
the planet. In the rejfion we are now re
viewing there are two, both of them strik
ing and peculiar Soils Pons and Lunae
Pons, the former joining Hammonis Cornu,
the great cape on the west side of the Sjrr
tis, to the northern end of Hellas, 4he lat
ter connecting In like manner the Circe
Promontorium, the cape on the east side of
the Syrtis, with Hellas. They both reach
Hellas at almost, if not exactly, the same
point.
These two curious links between light re
gions were first seen in 1894, about the tenth
of the Martian July.
To understand the significance of their
apppearance this year we must note the
time of the Martian year, owing to the dlf
fr.rr.nt snepds with which the earth and
Mars revolve about the sun. The earth
otrtakes Mars once in about two years
and two months. Such meetings are called
oppositions, because the planet is then seen
In the opposite part of the sky from the
sim. Now, as the periods of the two plan
ets are not exact multiples of each other.
Mars has made, like the earth, about two
of its months more than a revolution since
the two planets met. In consequence we
see him at a time about two months later
in his year, with his reasons corresponding
lv advanced.
Thus, when observations began this year,
it was not. in Martian time about the 1st
of May, but about the 1st of July. Now
as eoon as the planet was looked at there
was the Lunae Pons distinctly visible. It
appears singularly enough in the very first
drawing made, on July 23. Our July, this
Is, for it may be well to caution the reader
to xeep the two calendars distinct. Close
as ihe two dates of detection are for the
two Martian years, it is quite possible that
the phenomena required even nearer the
same Martian date than this. For, in the
first place, owing to the rotation of the
planet the same side of his surface is not
presented to the earth favorably for ob
servation but for a part of each forty
days, and it may therefore very well hap
pen that an event taking place at the
beginning of this observational gap may
not be noticed as having happened till the
end of it.
MR. LOWELL'S OBSERVATION.
In the next place different observers dif
fer in what they must readily perceive, and
it so chanced that the observer, Mr. Lowell,
who first saw the Lunae Pons on both oc
casions had not observed at just that Mar
tian time. It is Interesting to note that
these causeways are apparently optically
connected with Mr. Douglass's canals In
the dark regions, the one probably lying
alongside the other. In addition to the
causeways are the rhomboidal and other
bright areas that seasonably arise in the
Syrtis. Like the causeways, they have
made their anpearance after the summer
solstice of the southern hemisphere at both
oppositions.
Very curious features they are. One
called Oenotria, looking like a long sand
bar left high and dry on the receding of
the tide, is on the western coast of the
Syrtis and separated from Aeria by a deep
blue green canal. It is, however, not an
inundation or tide, but parching, that in all
probability produces the metamorphosis we
detect. The growth that in the heyday of
its springtime looks so green, quickened
by the water liberated from the south polar
cap, has by the first of its July passed into
the sere and yellow leaf.
The speed with which It undergoes Its
changes Is doubtless due to the greater
aridity of Mars, the water not being suffi
cient in amount to keep it longer alive.
That all this was vegetal, not marine, is
pretty conclusively shown, for the theory
that the so-called seas should show differ
ent tints implies that they were shallow
enough to be seen through a highly im
probable supposition on the face of it. That
they changed from blue green to orange
ochre over hundreds of square miles im
plies, on the supposition that they areseas,
an immense transference of water, which
would occasion a corresponding darkening
of other regions. No such corresponding
darkening took place.
Thirdly, that Mr. Douglass found them
traversed by dark lines is quite Incompat
ible with an aquatic character. Lastly, that
Professor Pickering, with the pclariscope,
found the only certain body of water on
the planet, the polar sea, to show evi
dence of being such, while the so-called
seas showed none, is further conclusive as
to their character.
From the dark areas we pass to the light
ones. Beside the Syrtis Major, to the west,
lies. Aerla. It 13 here that are to be found
the Phison and the Euphrates. During the
Martian spring this great light area is to
our present telescopic power one vast
blank, a huge desert no more, no less.
THE POLAR SEA.
When the advancing warmth has un
locked the polar snow and let the water
find its way, aerially and otherwise, to the
equator, strange lines begin to make their
appearance athwart this desert. Two of the
most conspicuous of them start from the
middle of the southern side of ihe desert
and run dlvergingly the one a little to the
east, the other a little to the west of north
down to the Nilosyrtis.
The eastward one is the Phison; the west
ward the Euphrates.
In this singleness of look and Intent each
continues until about the 1st of August,
Martian time, when two lines begin to
show where one showed before two lines
exactly paralleling the originals in posi
tion and direction. Indefinite at first, the
twin lines gain distinctiveness as time goes
on apparently solely by darkening, until
at last the doubling Is unmistakable, and
the two resemble nothing on earth so fiuch
as the twin rails of a railroad track.
All tlls happened two years ago at the
proper reason of the Martian year, and it
is all happening at the corresponding one
now. At the present moment the lines are
evidently double, but not very dark. The
duplication is following the example of the
Ganges in order of time, just as it did then.
The details of the process are curious
and suggestive. At the points where these
lines, which are almost spiderlike in tenu
ity, leave the dark regions there appear'
what look like nicks In the contour of the
edge of the desert. Wherever there are
canals there are nicks, and where there
are double canals there are double nicks.
Now, these nicks are more conspicuous
when well seen than the canals themselves,
although when not well seen the canals
are more easily detected, as long blurs,
because of their length.
Furthermore, they make their appear
ance apparently rather before the canal
Itself. Double nicks were seen where the
double canals start in 1S94. The same
double nicks at the confines of the deserts
are visible now.
What they are is one of the most inter
esting problems before us. They are prob
ably a sort of relay station for the water
on Its way from the canals in the dark,
region Into, those in the light.
Of the oases it is not our purpose to how
speak, although they, too, have made their
appearance Just as they appeared two years
ago. The significant point of the whole is
that the seasonal phenomena of the Mar
tian year are repeating themselves at this
present one, even to details. Tl at Mars is
not only a living world, but a very orderly
one to boot, is pretty conclusively shown
by the phenomena.

	<text>THE
fessor Edward S. Morse, curatorof the
department of Japanese pottery at the
Boston Museum of Fine Arts, says the
Boeton Herald.
Professor Morse, while not an astron
omer by profession, has made a special
study of Mars for many years. Hi
new bo6k, '"'Mars and It Mystery,"
which appeared early in October, con
tains some astonishing revelations
about our next-door neighbor in the
solar system.
Professor Morse thinks the inhabi
tants of Mara may raise tobacco exten
sively. The Martians may be even
greater smokers than the men. of the
earth. How Professor Morse got this
idea is best explained in his own
words.:
"At certain times there has been ob
served in the equatorial region of Mars
a number of white spots, which have
greatly puzzled the student of Mars,
and for which no explanation has yet
been- offered. That they are not clouds
is seen in the fact that they do not
move or drift. Furthermore, these
white spots are fixed features of the
region, as they appear in the same
places.. ._,.:._
'.'It might "Ke* suggested "that they
represent snow-capped elevations or
mountain peaks, but this is difficult to
believe, as an examination of the ter
minator of Mars reveals no evidences
of -high elevations. These white spots
appear only in midsummer, which
would argue against their being snow
caps, as in midsummer they would cer
tainly melt and disappear. The time
of their appearance coincides with the
time of greatest equatorial heat.
"Since the appearance of these
white spots in Mars corresponds with
the period of greatest evaporation, it
is conceivable that an intelligence in
Mars might utilize the same method
which has recently been adopted in
Connecticut and Porto Rico in the
raising of tobacco, namejy, to protect
the fields with white cotton cloth."
It is the canals of Mars, however,
that furnish Professor Morse with the
strongest evidence of life on the red
planet. On this point he quotes Pro
fessor Pcrcival Lowell of Boston, who
has made more extensive obrervations
of the Martian canals than any other
astronomer. He says:
"What we see hints of the existence
of beings who are in advance of, not
behind, us in the -journey of life."
Problems of a Dying World.
A peculiar interest is excited in these
superior beings because they have
grappled with the problems of a dying
world. They have learned how to ex-,
ist on a desert planet where water is
the scarcest and most precious thing in
existence. Their whole world is much
like the Sahara desert, or the flat des
ert plain of our own Arizona.
Yet on a dried-up world of this -sort
they evidently have built up and con
tinue to maintain a civilization far in
advance of anything on the earth. This
is indicated by the complex canal sys
tem that prevails all over their globe.
One of their canals alone is over 3,000
miles in length, long enough to reach
from Boston to San Francisco. In
deed, canals on Mars seem to be
aswiths
numerous as railroads on the earth.
Professor Morse has made a drawing
showing how similar some parts of our
network of railroads are to the Martian
canal lines. The canals of Holland also
present a similarity. These illustra
tions are set forth to show that such
markings must be the works of intelli
gent beings rather than the haphazard
cracks or markings of nature. Profes
sor Morse sums up the argument in fa
vor of the Martian canals being arti
ficial in these words:
"The unnatural straightness of these
interlacing lines on Mars, many of
them following the arcs of great cir
cles their unilorm width thruout, their
always starting from definite areas, their
convergence to common centers, find
no parallel in natural phenomena.''
Where these canals meet one another
are circular areas, indicating great
oases, and probably large cities.
Professor Morse gained much of the
material for this book by a visit to
the southwest. He spent five weeks at
Professor Lowell's observatory at Flag
staff, Ariz. In the dry, steady, clear
air, 7,000 feet above sea level, ho
studied the surface of Mars thru a
telescope. He saw the pale yellow disk
of the planet gradually develop a net
work of dark markings. I was like
a photographic plate, first blank and
then mysteriously taking on shades and
lines.till a world picture was presented.
Looking about him in that desert re
gion, Professor Morse found an explan
ation of the Martian mystery.
Explanation of the Martian Mystery.
"Let one stand on some peak of the
Verde mountains," he said, "northeast
from Phoenix, Ariz., overlooking the
Gila river as it follows its course across
the desert, and after the river is lost
to view he will notice that the foliage
/long its banks marks its course.

"If one $ake$ this view in" winter
time, the ui=iform gray of the plains,
Unbroken by^fe-shade of color, blends
with the lightsbitt^.of the distant Plo
mas and Ca&tle.Dome mountains on the
southwest horizon. In the early spring,
when the water is first let into the
irrigating channels, with their innumer
able divergent ditches, a, shade of green
may be seen emerging from the monot
onous yellow-gray of the hot and ster
ile plain, first conspicuous near the
source of the water supply, and then
following along to Phoenix, Temple and
other regions, till in full efflorescence
these cities stand out like great green
carpets spread upon the earth.
From this mountaintop not a trace
of an irrigating ditch, large or small,
would be discerned, except here and
there a glint, of reflected sunlight, but
the effects of the life-giving waters can
be traced in broad bands to the re-?
motest limits of the water channels,
when they would end as abruptly as
they had begun."
Professor Morse makes this explana
tion to illustrate how wide areas of
vegetation may be seen at a great dis
tance, so great, indeed, that canals
themselves would be invisible. The
canals of Mars are believed to be gi
gantic irrigating ditches, very similar
to those now in operation in the'west
and those being constructed by.tbe-govr
eminent.
As life on Mars appears to be sus
tained solely by irrigation, it would
seem that its inhabitants. are great ag
riculturists. We are only beginnings to
learn how to produce vegetation and
sustain life on deserts. But the. Mar
tian have covered their whole globe
irrigation works. Professor
Morse thinks they must understand the
principles-of hydraulics far better than
our best civil engineers.,
Their sole source of water supply
seems to be the snow caps that- form
at the poles during the winter. When
these snowcaps begin to melt, the wa
ter is conducted by the canals clear
down to the equator, and probablv
every drop of it conserved and used
over and over again for irrigating the
land.
Inhabitants of the Planet. .,V'
What manner of beings these are
that have created such a prodigious,
universal waterworks system is a mys
tery. Professor Morse appears to
think they may be like men or gigan
tic ants. For men and ants, he ob
serves, exist at the greatest extremes
of elevation, where the air is heaviest
and rarest, as well as in places where
the climate is hottest and coldest.
On Mars the air is exceedingly/rare,
about half the density of the atmos
phere on the highest mountain tops of
the earth. A man from the earth sud
denly transported there, Professor
Morse thinks, would give a few gasps
and die. But the rarefaction of the
air has taken place by very slow de
grees, and for this reason Professor
Morse conjectures that man might sur
vive the change. He says on this point:
"One has only to make himself fa
miliar with the wide range of. cond^
tions under which life in various forms
exists on the earth to realize that the
introduction of Martian" conditions here
would not be such an overwhelming
calamity. If these conditions could be
introduced by minute increments cover
ing thousands of centuries, it' is not
unreasonable to believe that myriads
of forms would survive the change
and among those that survive would be
precisely th$ kinds that thrive under
the most diverse conditions here, name-

ly, man and the higher hymenoptera,
the ants."
We have the choice, then, of consid
ering the Martian either a man or gi
gantic being,, adapted to breathing the
rarefied air, or a mammoth ant. Pro
fessor Morse seems to lean to the idea
that a creature very like man is theof
Martian intelligent being.
What Martians Might Say of Us.
One of the most interesting parts
of Professor Morse's book is the chap
ter on "What the Martians Might Say
of Us," which begins:
"For every single perplexity of inter
pretation we encounter in our study of
the surface markings of Mars the Mar
tian would encounter a dozen perplexi
ties in interpreting the various features
on the surface of the earth.

pretation of the surface features of

	<text>Professor
Pcrclval Lowell, our greatest M.'.rtlan
student, now declare* positively and
without reservation that our nearest
planetary neighbor is not only alive
with vegetation made possible by
means of vast artificial canals, but is
peopled by an order of beings In many
respects quite superior to ourselves!
In other words, Professor Lowell has
solved, at U-ast to his own satisfaction,
the greatest riddle of the ages — the ex
isfnep of life in another world!
Since 1877, when Sehiaparelll aston
ished laymen and astronomers by an
nouncing the discovery of the Martian
«.anals, etar gazers have kept their eyes
focused upon th« face of the red maned
planet. Acres of white, paper have been
covered with notes of whst they saw.
And. finally, Profrssor Lowell and his
aids at the Flagstaff observatory suc
ceeded in actually photographing the
Martian canals. His new volunio, 1s-
Mi.-,i by the Macmillan Company, Ik the
first formal announcement of his recent
«i!(srrvatlonß «.nd conclusions that has
horn published. Not only in hln verdict
liipliiy revolutionary from a scientific
viewpoint, but It is no lc«e daring tlian
convincing when v|pw*d Impartially.
Stupendous ax the conclusion is from
t'to facts presented *b calmly and dis
pOßsionately by Professor Lowell, we
arc nou 1 actually Introduced to b'-ings
oaj Mtr« resembling ourselves In many
«'?»entla.l features.
owlnr. for instance, to the vast d*s
<it areas there — to the uttf r absence of
water on most of the surface — It Is
reasonable to suppose that the Martian
means of transportation are other than
our own. For the people must com
municate with one another, since. Pro
feasor Lowell is convinced, water from
the poles Is distributed among the pop
ulous oases hundreds and thousands of
miles apart. And the only possible
agency, in view of the physical flatness
of the planet and of the fact that the
force of gravity at any distance from
the eonter of Mars is only one-tenth
the gravity toward the center of the
«>«rth at the same distance, is artificial.
If. In other words, our force of gravity
its represented by 100. It !« only 27 on
Mars, co-nslflerlny that Mars is only .63
the size of the onrth. There our pound
would weigh only about six ounces, and
it Martian of human «ixe murt be more
than twtre as strong as the. average
man here. ' •
Without indulging In mental aero
nautics on*> reaches the logical conclu
sion that aerial navigation 1* the easl
rrt and most reasonable means of
transportation for our etarry neigh
bors. Indeed, it if not improbable that
they are equipped, granting their ex
istence, with such knowledge of nat
ure! forces, or euoh physical attributes,
as may enable them to propel tliem
erjves from place to place as would our
own mechanical birds. Following are
tho salient feature* in this amazing
message from Mare:
Professor Lowell
«-|— HAT Mars is Inhabited by beings
I of one sort or another w? may con
sider as certain. The theory of an
existent Intelligent life there may be
likened to the atomic theory in chem
istry: tho behavior of chemle com
pounds points to the existence of atoms
too 'email for u» to see. and in the same
way the aspect and behavior of the
Martian markings Imply the action of
agents too far away, as yet, to be dis
cerned.
Though In neither case ran we tell
anything of the bodily manifestation,
we can, In both, affirm a good deal about
their workings. Girdling Mars, for ex
ample, and stretching from pole to
pole, the Martian canal system not
only embraces their whole world,* but
is an organized entity. Each canal
Joins another, which in turn connects
with a third, and co on over the entire
surface of the planet This continuity
of construction proves a community
of Interest; and when we consider that,
though not «o large ac the earth, the
world, of Mars Is 4200 miles in diam
eter. and contains something like 212,
000,000 square miles, the unity of the
process acquires considerable signifi
cance. The eupposod vast enterprises
of the earth are. dwarfed by .compari
son, being merely as a civic subway
compared with one of continental pro
portions.
The first thing that is forced on us In
carefully studying conditions on the
planet Is the necessarllyMntelllgent and
peaceful character of the community
which could thus act as a unit through
out its globe. War is a survival
among us from savage times, and af
fects chiefly the boyish and unthinking
element of the cation. The wls«st
realize that there are better ways" for
practicing heroiFiri and other and more
certain means of insuring the survival
of the fittest. War is something a
people outgrow. But, whether they
consciously practice peace or not, na
ture In Ite evolution practices it for
them, . "
Whether Increasing common, sense cr
Increasing necessity was the spur; that
drove the Martians tp this 'eminently
sagacious state, it Is certain; that they
have reached It and. actually certain

faint forecasts of the state of things
on Mars today. *
From the detection of the main
markings on the planet surface we now
pass to a discovery so unprecedented
that the scientific world was at first
loth to accept it— that of the canals.
Not everybody can- see these delicate
lines at first sight, even when pointed
ont to them. When viewed under* the
best conditions, however, the disk of
thc planet takes on a most singular
appearance. It looks as if it had been
cobwebbed all over — a. mesh of nno
lines which., with ( attention, proves to
compass tho globe from one pole to the
other. ~~
It Is due wholly to the lack of suit
able conditions-that the true form; of
the Martian lines is usually missed.
Given the proper prerequisites of loca
tion or of,eye, and their pencil mark
peculiarly stands forth unmistakably
confessed. The sole method of esti
mating their width is by comparison
of effect with a wire of known size at a
Known distance. For this purpose a
telegraph wire was stretched against
the sky at Flagstaff, and the observers,
going back upon the mesa, observed
and recorded its appearance as their,
stations: grew remote, it proved sur- v
prising at what great distances a alewwf
derwire could be made out wheff thua
projected against the sky. The wire in
the experiment was but .0728 of an
inch in diameter and yet could be seen
with certainty at a distance of igoo
feet, at which point Its diameter sub
tended only .69 of a second of are. How
small this is may be appreciated from
its taking more than ninety such lines
laid side by side tomake a width divis
ible iby the eye. Theoretically, then a
line three-fourths of. a mile wide on
Mars-would be visible to us through
our powerful:telescopes.-
But we will take a mile or two safety
as the smallest width for one of the
lines.. The greatest waa got by com

	<text> , ilany interesting theories about
i hi tte life of Mars have been put
iafc forward, but all of them have been
jb open to some objection. Professor
Laa : Percival Lowell, of the Flagstaff
' Obaervatory in Arizona, has argued
1(y9 that the so-called canals of Mars sire
sflr1 . vast engineering works, and con
5," ' cequently that the inhabitants who
ffyti bailt thera were of great intellectual

$f-2m tremely interesting story ou the
basis Hint the Martians are octopus
like creatures, without bony struc
ture, but possessed of highly devel
oped brains. A common assumption of
many speculators has been that
the Martians are extremely at
tenuated creatures, because the
slight pressure of gravity on the
surface of the planet would favor
this form.
Now a new and exceedingly inter
esting theory concerning the life
on Mars has been put forward by
Professor William Wallace Camp
bell, of the great Lick Observatory,
California. He suggests that all
life ou Mars has taken a vegetable,
form.
ThlK. -ttfGory Is one of the most
plausible that bns been put
forward. It has the support of all
the facts about Mars that have been
scientifically established and it
avoms many of the improbabilities
involved In other theories on the
same 3ubjecL t
The vegetation theory rests pri
marily on the fact proved by spec
troscopic analysis that there is an
enormous proportion of carbonic
acid gas In the atmosphere of Mars
which would make animal ijfG n'f.
the kind known to the earth er
coedingly dllfleull, if not impossible,
while it would greatly favor the
development of vegetation.
Before considering this theory
.further, we must bear in mind a
few of the proved facts about Mars.
It has atmosphere, seasons, land,
wator. storms, clouds and moun
tains. It also rains and snows on
Mars, as it does with us. Great
white patches appear periodically
upon Its surface. These may be
accumulations of snow and they
have also been called "eyes." Their
nature will be discussed later.
When Mars approaches nearest to
the earth it is. seen to. have a. bright
rod color and sometimes looks like
a red lamp in the sky. It has been
suggested that the vegetation for
tho most part Is yellow or orange
instead of green, as with us, thus
giving the planet its color.
Mars has two moons, the near
est of which Is but 3,700 miles away
and revolves around the planet in
seven hours and a half, showing
all the phases of our moon in one
night.

The atmosphere and

any, must find life a dif

The water Is confined
entirely to the poles,

ed. Here .we may
note one of the
strongest arguments tn favor of the
vegetation theory of life.
Professor Lowell has argued that
the canals of Mars, first discovered
by Professor Scbiaparelli, of Milan,
but long considered optical Illusions
by mauv astronomers, are the ir
rigation " works of the inhabitants.
The canals are singularly artificial
in appearance. They extend toward

variably runs to a pclnt called "an
oasis." where it meets other cauals
not lu haphazard fashion, but ac
cording -to some plan.
The "canals" vary in longth from
2r0 miles to over 3,000
miles, a length that is astonishing
when it is considered that thv
diameter of Mars is only 4,220
miles. All told, Professor Lowell
has plotted -137 of tbeso canals and
1S6 oases. It was Professor Pick
ering, a close associate of Profcsso.
Lowell, who first saw these oases

Winter. If thc canals are artlficla.
In origin, this phenomenon would
appear to mean that the Martians
are busily engaged in digging stu
pendous canals, only to fill them up
again every year.
Professor Pickering Ingeniously
avoided this embarrassing conclu
sion by pointing out that we see
not the canals themselves, but tho
vegetation which friuges their
banks and thus indicates their
com sc. Vegetation must grow be

Here we can see why the theory
that all the life ou Mars is vege

other. Professor Pickering admits

Due to the very rare Martian. atmosphere the

poorly, hence the large ears, necessary'to catch the
very weak sounds. Due to the poor atmosphere it
ia exceedingly cold on Mara, except at (he equator.
Hence Martians are covered with a white polar fur
from head to foot A rare atmospheris conducts
odors but poorly, hence die elephantine nose, which
goes to die odor, as the odor can't come to the
Martian.

the? do, they probably think that all of
out acta are due to "Instinct." In their way
they are probably right It depends only
upon the point of view.
But given like conditions evolution will
progress alike In widely separated spheres.
The Indians on the American Continent
developed about the same as the Euro
peans, although they had not intermingled
for thousands of years. It is not even ab
solutely certain that they have not sprung
into being on their own accord.
Following this line of reasoning?and the
writer admits it may be all wrong?there
Is a strong chance that the Martian has de
veloped In s manner similar to that of man
on earth. As a matter of fact, the chances
are greaJy In Its favor. If w? grant this
truth. It should be easy to form a mental
picture of the Martian under his present
unfavorable conditions upon his planet.
To begin with, the Martian race, millions
of years older tuan the terrwitrlal, must
have advanced tremendously. The Mar
tian's head, due to his greatly developed
brain, must be enormous. On account of
the low gravitational force on Mars, where
his body is pulled downward with only one
third of the weight as that on earth, the
Martian must be of great height. He is at
least ten or twelve feet tall. Geotropism
on earth proves this amply.
To support such a tall body where grav
ity is so small, better footing Is necessary,
hence the big (eet are required. The tre
mendously civilized Martian always rides
or flies from [la to place; his legs are
thus Mnjpst unless. Just l'u* a sto'V's, for

Due to the very rare Martian atmos
phere, the Martian's cheat must be enor
Pious to accommodate the ponderous
lungs which are necessary to supply air
and oxygen to his large body. On the
other hand, rare atmosphere conducts
sound very poorly, hence large ears are
required to catch the exceedingly weak
sounds.
As already mentioned, due to the poor
atmospl^ere, it is exceedingly cold on Mars,
except at the equator. Even here it is
freezing. Hence Martians are probably
oovered from head to foot with a white
polar fur. A rare atmosphere conducts
odors but rocly. We thus nay expect the
man on Mars to have an elephantine nose,
which goes to the odor, as the odor can't
com* to the Martian.
The Martian must certainly have
stopped all bodily work millions of years
ago; machines have done his work for
ages. His arms thus are weak and thin.
But the hands and eyes?the Martian's
most Important organs?are used and
worked constantly and therefore are de
veloped to an undreamed of degree.
He probably has six or more fingers on
his hands Even on earth we have already
?ix-flngered human beings.
His eyes probably can be extended from
their sockets at the end of a sort of ten
tacle, the same as a snail's. This gives the
Martian a larger range of vision, without
the trouble of moving his head about As

This statement need not be ridiculed.
Certain animals, each as our ants, havo a
highly developed telepathic orean. Stu
dents of ants know that the killing of one
ant will be Immediately sensed by others,
although ten or more feet distant. And
within a few seconds they will hare ar

The possibility that Mars is inhabited
by strange creatures like that pictured on
this page it itrengthened by the fact that
in other parts of the universe life persists
under the moat extreme conditions imag
inable. Certain species of fish may be
frozen stone hard for days, and will revive
after thawing out.
Thirty years ago it was strenuously de
nied that there could be living creatures

to meet the peculiar conditions existing
on Mars.

could be suddenly transported to Mars be

lesser gravitational pull on Mjrs.
But in return for this reduction In his

certain compensations. He would be able
to leap a distance of eleven feet into the

would be able to pick up and carry off ?

A cannon flred from this earth would
have to attain a velocity of five miles a
second in order to shoot a project.le into
the air so that it would never return. But
a projectile fired from Mnrs at the rate of
only a small fraction more than a mile a
second would never return to the planet
but would become a new satellite.
What scientists term the low velocity
of escape is believed to have an impor
tant bearing upon the possibility of the
planet's possessing and holding stmoe

clothed with ao extensive atmosphere it
is believed, according to the pinetlc theory

"Grand, Intense, Formidable/9
Says M. Perrier
By Arnold D. Prince
IF IT should prove to be the case
after all that those mysterious
Marconi "messages" came from
Mars or even Venus, the next
problem of importance will be the
"dud of people who sent them. For,
of course, if the earth is to have new
neighbors with whom to exchange
gossip across the back yard of the
sidereal firmament, it will want to
know something about them. It will
want to know something of their
habits, appearance, how they dress,
act and possibly their views on in?
terplanetary relations. All sorts of
situations may arise wherein a
mutual understanding of personal
traits, characteristics and general
disposition will aid in establishing
and preserving amicable relations.
Signor Marconi, unfortunately,
was not able to throw much light on
the subject. Virtually all that came
within the scope of his observation
was that when prosecuting wireless '
experiments certain "signals oc?
curred'' with persistent regularity
which could not be explained on the
theory of casual interference. As '
these signals had been received
"simultanecuslv_ at New York and
London with identical intensity," he
admitted the possibility of their be?
ing attempts by the inhabitants of
fother planets to communicate"

Nor is there anything specially help?
ful in such suggestions as emanated
recently from one authority, who,
when asked his opinion as to the
population on Venus, replied with
hopeful animation that they were
"chorus girls." Such jocularity is
merely beclouding the issue and add?
ing difficulties to a problem that is
difficult enough as it is.
Among scientists who have won
the righ*- to speak with authority
. the foreu?v- was the late Professor
Percival Lowell, director of the
observatory at Flagstaff, Ariz.
Professor Lowell was the brother
of Abbott Lawrence Lowell, presi?
dent of Harvard University. Be?
fore taking charge at Flagstaff he
had been attached to the observa?
tory at Harvard and had conducted
astronomical investigations in many
parts of the world, including Japan,
Tripoli, the Andes and other coun?
tries. He had delivered lectures on
his findings before important scien?
tific societies in Great Britain and
the United States.
Not only was Professor Lowell
convinced that Mars was inhabited,
but he believed the people had a
"?finch higher degree of intelligence
than those on earth. He dwelt
Particularly on their inventive
genius.
*i*eat Inventors
"Quite possibly," wrote Professor
'-owell in his book, "the Martian
[oik are possessed of inventions of
which we have not dreamed, and
"With them electrophones and kineto
scopes are things of a bygone past,
preserved with veneration in mu?
teras as relic? of the clumsy con?
trivances of the simple childhood of
the race.
'Certainly, what we see hints at
the existence of beings who are in
advance of, not behind, us in the
Journey of life.
"Startling as the outcome of
?**? observations' may appear at
-fr"*-"? in truth there ia npthing
?tartling about it whatever. Such
P?ttibility has been quite on the
??***? ?ver aince the existence of
-P*9HmM ?M -mocBisMd by the
Chaldean shepherds, or whoever the
still more primitive astronomers
may have been. Its strangeness is
a purely subjective phenomenon,
arising from the instinctive reluc?
tance of mind to admit the possi?
bility of peers. Such would be comic
were it not the inevitable conse?
quence of the constitution of the
universe. To be shy of anything
resembling himself is part and par?
cel of man's own individuality.
"Like the savage, who fears noth?
ing so much as a strange man; like
Crusoe, who grows pale at the sight
of footprints not his own, the civi?
lized thinker turns from the thought
of mind other than he himself
knows."
The peculiar relevancy of this
view to the discussion resulting from
Signor Marconi's announcement will
strike- any one who reads Professor
Lowell's statement. His brother
scientists were indeed "shy," as he
had predicted, of the deductions
reached by him, but they at least
contained the views of the Flagstaff
astronomer as to the kind of people,
who, if we accept the pleasing possi?
bility suggested by Signor Marconi,
are trying to "strike up a speaking
acquaintance" with us. Not only are
they masters in the knowledge of
electricity, but they have already
relegated to the museum of antiqui?
ties many of the discoveries in that
field which we, here on earth, look
upon as last minute achievements in
scientific effort.
Professor Lowell, while comment?
ing strongly on the intellectual at?
tainments of the Martians, made
little or no reference to the actual
appearance of the folk living on that
distant planet True, he did say in
another part of his book that they
probably were not interested in
party politics, and that, judging from
their canals, they were favored by a
"comprehensiveness" of mind much
more embracive than that "which
presided over the various depart?
ments of our own public works" in
the United States, but as politicians
look much like other persons very
little could be gained from that.
First Martian Pictures
It was M. Edmond Perrier, direct?
or of the museum of the Jardin des
Plantes, in Paris, who constructed
the first picture of the Martians, as
he conceived them.
At the time M. Perrier undertook
this task the division among the au?
thorities on Professor Lowell's the?
ory had assumed wide p reportions.
Some were decidedly "cold" to the
notion that Mars?the question as to
Venus was temporarily in eclipse?
was inhabited at all, and they con?
sidered it futile and profitless, there?
fore, to attempt to depict a non-ex?
istent people. Others, as has hap?
pened even recently, considered the
matter in a light vein, thinking to
get some humor out of it, and one
newspaper carried a cartoon, cap
tioned "Hello Central," showing Pro?
fessor Lowell "calling up" Mars.
Still another group seemed to take
it as a personal affront that the as?
tronomer had sought to enlarge their
list of acquaintances by introducing
a race about which they had abso?
lutely no knowledge.
M. Perrier approached the problem
from a highly speculative viewpoint,
but made clear the fact, nevertheless,
that he saw no reason for condemn?
ing the position of Professor Lowell.
"Dreams are not a crime," con?
tended the French scholar, "and in
this case contradiction i? difficult."
The director of the museum of
the Jardin des Plantes led up to his
description of the inhabitants of
Man by ?rtabiiahing the premia?,
that conditions on Mars are not
inimical to human life. Rain, snow,
thunder and hail are known there,
as on earth. There are seaweeds in
the ocean, grass and trees on the
land, fields available for cultivation
and a friendly soil to provide food
for the people.
"The life which animates the
earth also animates other planets,"
said the French savant. "From what
goes on around us we may divine
what is happening elsewhere by ex?
amining the exact conditions under
which each planet finds itself en
rapport with ? every other. On the
planets which are furthegt away,
it is impossible that human beings
should exist, for no organism could,
for example, be formed in the al?
kaline seas of Jupiter, while Mer?
cury, which is too near the sun,
could not engender life. Only Venus,
the Earth and Mars are habitable."
On Mars, M. Perrier went on, life
is "grand, intense, formidable." The
mean temperature is 40 degrees
Fahrenheit, as against 76 degrees
on earth, the winters are more se?
vere, the summers warmer, the year
longer and the seasons more marked
than ours.
The sea animals are, much like
ours, the fishes have a sense of hear?
ing, there are insects in the animal
kingdom and flowers and butterflies,
but the humans are very, very differ?
ent.
Before going on and giving M. Per?
ri?re picture of the kind of people
the Martians are, and in order to re
assure such sensitive souls as may I
fear to establish speaking relations I
with a people too alien in -appearance
to make acceptable neighbors, it
should be stated that M. Perrier does
not agree with the conception of the
Martians set forth by H. G. Wells in
his book "War of the Worlds." Mr.
Wells, in that work, caused the Mar?
tians to resemble cuttlefish, with
round, gray bodies, with "sort of
faces" and long, groping tentacles.
This conception, M. Perrier as?
serted, did the Martians a great in?
justice and created a prejudice
against them, which is not only un?
scientific and unsound, but entirely
undeserved.
The Martians, the French scholar
held, bear a certain resemblance to
man, although many of their fea?
tures are more prominent. For this,
the difference in the forces of grav?
ity and in environment are chiefly
responsible, he said. Their ears, for
example, are very large.
Continniug? tie? gsmtos of thai
museum of the Jardin des Plantes]
said:
. "The low atmospheric pressure
has produced a considerable devel?
opment of the pulmonary apparatus,
and consequently the general char?
acter of the Martians has been in?
fluenced by this development, which
is unknown on earth.
Why Martians Are Tall
"The men on Mars are tall be?
cause the force of gravity is slight.
They are blond, because the daylight
is less intense. They have less pow?
erful limbs. They have some of the
characteristics of our Scandinavian
type, although they probably have
larger skulls.
"Their large blue eyes, theii
strong noses, their large ears, con?
stitute a type of beauty which we
doubtless would not appreciate ex?
cept as suggesting superhuman in?
telligence."
Going further into details, M. Per
rier concluded that the jaw of the
Martian is narrower than ours.be
cause time and evolution have re
moved him further from his anima
forebears than they have us. His |
lung capacity is enormous because of
the thin atmosphere, although his
legs are extremely thin, due to the
little effort needed in walking. He
has little or no neck.
Touching on the question of intel?
ligence, the French savant deduced
j that ' the Martians have solved the
problem of existence, and know no
such thing as industrial strife. Be?
ing older, they are also wiser than
we. They have long since conquered
disease, and know the hour of their
demise, awaiting the event calmly.
They have overcome poverty, are
too sophisticated to engage in war,
and need no law or government to
keep them orderly. Philosophers
and brothers, they live in amity and
understanding, devoting all their
thought to the promotion of large
undertakings in which selfishness,
avarice and earthly trifles have no
part.
They are, in a word, as different
from tha ?*ncifui And unpieasing
picture painted by Wells as are we
from the Simian types referred to
by Darwin.
Returning to tho question of flora
and fauna, M. Perrier concluded
that because of the reduced force
of gravity, animals are much larger
on Mars than here, and hop, run
and fly about much more easily.
Grass is higher, fruit is bigger, and
the flowers possess undreamed of
beauty. The light is something lik?
our dusk, and the general landscape
much more attractive than on
earth.
"The year on Mars is twice as
long as our earthly one," he ex?
plained, "and hence plants and in?
sects have twice the time in whicr
to evolve. Mars is the land of hug?
plants and ideal flowers, of bird;
abnormally powerful in song an<
wondrous in appearance, and o:
four-footed animals with extraor?
dinarily developed fur and skin."
Neither M. Perrier ?or the other
scientists who believe in the habita
bility of other worlds paid so much
attention to Venus. They agreed,
however, with the head of the Jardin
des Plantes that as this planet is
much younger than the earth,
life there is much less advanced.
Because of the greater nearness to
the sun, the climate is something
like that in our tropics, and the air
is always misty. Animals and plants
are much like ours, especially at the.
poles, where the temperature is not
so high, but humans are not much
beyond the development that existed
on earth during the secondary geo?
logical period.
Not From Venus
In other words, there is much less
likelihood that those strange Marv
coni signals came from Venus than
that they came from Mars. j
Having thus disposed o? the kind j
of beings supposed to exist on the
only two eligible planets, two other
questions arise?Why are the Mar?
tians or the Venusians trying to
communicate with us, that is, if they
are? and, What atmospheric condi?
tions will we on earth have to over?
come in order to reply to them?
As to tho first question, a possible
explanation may be found in Jtha
so-called cataclysm on Mars that was
I reported by the British Astronomical
Association in 1909. In that year
the "planet of mystery" was nearer
to earth than at any time since 1892,
and so in a favorable position for
observation.
The phenomenon which was her?
alded as without parallel in the rec?
ords of the past was the appearance
of a gloomy, yellow veil which en?
shrouded immense tracts of the Mar?
tian surface, obliterating important
markings.
On account of the theory, then
recently advanced by Professor
Lowell, that Mars was inhabited, the
changes aroused extraordinary inter?
est. It previously had I*? ;i sug?
gested that the canals on the planet
had been constructed by a dying
race, a race menaced by starvation
on a desert planet, which had sought
by means of these enormous via?
ducts to carry water from t?e melt?
ing ice caps at the poles, and the
appearance of the yellow mist com?
bined with the simultaneous erasure
of some of the canal markings gave
riso to the fear that a gigantic
i
Professor Lowell Held That Mar?
tians Were Far Advanced in
Inventions and Science
catastrophe had occurred, the effects
of which were only too apparent.
Can it be, some of the observers
of conditions now are asking, that
CCIENTISTS agree that
*"* the people of Mars differ
from us in many ways. The
Martians are believed to
have very large noses and
ears and immense lung de?
velopment, because of the
rarefied atmosphere. Their
legs are poorly developed, be?
cause matter on Mars weighs
less than here and sturdy
legs are not needed to bear
their weight. Birds and but?
terflies are very large and j
beautiful
?some such similar catastrophe has j
overtaken the Martians, who, in
their desperation, are attempting to
communicate the fact to us?
In August, 1909, astronomers
working at their telescopes had re?
ported what they surmised to be a
new fracture of the southern polar
cap and the appearance of a dark
streak along the line of the break.
About the same time a brilliant spot,
which may have been a segment of
the shattered terrain, had- separated
itself from the polar cap and had
moved over to one of the dusky
areas of the planet, partly hiding it
from view.
Great Convulsion Possible
All this seemed to strengthen the
theory of a huge convulsion ad?
vanced by the British scientists, al?
though, as seems to be the fate of all
questions concerning this much dis?
cussed and little understood celes?
tial body, eminent authorities at
once took opposing ground on the
subject.
Professor Harold Jacoby, Ruther?
ford Professor of Astronomy at
Columbia University, contended that
"the Martians are not likely to have
their world destroyed any more than
are we," adding that if any such
catastrophe as hinted had actually
occurred the news would have be?
come known through some quicker
channel than the British Astro?
nomical Association. By this, it
should be explained hastily, Profes?
sor Jacoby did not mean that the
scientists across the Atlantic were
slower in observation than others,
| but only that the disaster would
have been revealed by telescopes
! everywhere long before a formal
| report could have been prepared.
Professor F. R. Moulton, of the
! University of Chicago, also doubted
the accuracy of the report, and Pro?
fessor Lowell himself, author of the
notion that Mars is inhabited, was
not particularly impressed with it. .
Professor Lowell, it will be re?
membered, held to the belief that
the Martians were anything but a
starving, needy people, and he con?
stantly sought to fortify his posi?
tion by offering new proofs of their
prosperity, advancement and skill.
In 1914 he found a new opportunity
for strengthening his pet belief by
announcing that instead of losing
any of their canals the Martians
had built two new ones, which could
be seen plainly through the tele?
scope.
"We have actually seen them
formed under our eyes," Professor
| Lowell said at the time, "and the
| importance of it car. hardly be over?
estimated. Tho phenomenon tran?
scends any natural law, and is only
explicable sc far as can be seen by
the presence out yonder of animate
will." By animate will he meant, of
course, human beings.
Professor Lowell was admittedly
tho leading spokesman for the
Martians, and anything he said
was worthy of the moat respectful
consideration, but in view of recent
developments many thinkers are
asking if, after all, he was not mis?
taken in at least one particular,
and if the "signals" picked up in
New York and London were not
efforts on their part to notify the
earth folk of their desperate plight.
Xo unusual manifestations to sup?
port this view have been witnessed
recently on the distant planet, but?
it is at least a new guess on the
subject, which is all that its origi?
nators claim for it.
Tesla Believes It
To Nikola Tesla there is nothing
remarkable or impossible in the sug?
gestion that the mysterious signals
are from the Martians. Discussing
the question, he said:
"To most people the mere idea of
flashing a signal over the immense
gulf of 50,000,000 or 100,000,000
miles will naturally appear prepos?
terous, but as I have stated in an
article I wrote for 'The Harvard
Illustrated Magazine' of March,
1907, it is simply a feat of electrical
engineering, apparently hazardous,
but made perfectly feasible through
inventions with which the experts
are familiar.
"That the planets are inhabited is
a foregone conclusion. It would be
stupid to deny the existence of con?
ditions suitable for the development
of organic life on other plftnet3."
The next question is how the
earth is to reply to these signals,
supposing they are signals at all
and what are the atmospheric ob
s-itacles that will have to be over
come.
Mars at times is only 50,000,00
miles away from the earth and a
other times 250,000,000. ft is frc
quently surrounded by vapors, a
is the case, too, with Venus, wfsicl
would be extremely difficult of pen
etration by light radiation, but thi
chief problem to be met would bi
the creation of a wireless apparatui
of sufficient strength to send a mes
sage over the required distance
Dr. Charles P. Steinmetz, chief con
suiting engineer of the Genera
Electric Company, believes such ai
instrument possible, provided tb
world devoted itself to the inventioi
with the same thoroughness it em
ployed in the great war, but esti
mates it would cost at least $1,000,
000,000 to do it
Wireless messages have bee
transmitted over a distance of fror.
3,000 to 4,000 miles when condition
were favorable, although an officii
of the Radio Corporation of Amei
ica, of which the Marconi system :
a part, said that signals had bee
sent as far as 10,000 miles und?
unusual circumstances.
"But there is one thing thi
should be remembered," said Davi
Sarnoff, comme??ial manager of ?
Radio Corporation of America, "thi
there are a great many conditions i
the atmosphere of which we do n<
know, even when sending a m-sssag
say, across the Atlantic or even
shorter distance.
"We know something about wa*
lengths, and we know what happe:

we receive it, but what happens <

0 United States, where radio has developed
1- in leaps and bounds during the last year
s or so. If he is to succeed in catching the
" iar nung messages irom mars 11 win De
here.
Probably the most serious difficulty,
aside from the engineering features of
the strange groping through space of two
planets, Is the lack of a common medium
for the exchange of thought. However,
if the Martians can generate a wave
length to reach from their planet to ours.
It Is possible that they will be of such
super-mentality that they will easily overcome
this drawback.
Again the question, "What will be the
first message from Ma$s?" Injects itself.
What will It reveal?
Will It plunge our earth back a thousand
years? Will it make our radio, telephonic
and telegraphic systems seem, by
comparison with those of Mars, to be as
crude as the smoke signals of the Indian
or the tomtom wireless of the African
bushman? Such questions as these are,
indeed, fearful to contemplate.
And how about the Martian himself?
the subject of so much earthly speculation?
Will he be, as II. G. Wells describes
him In his book "War of the Worlds," a
cross between a cuttlefish and a monkey,
with a round grayish body, with a "sort
of a face" and long, groping tentacles?a
gruesome, hideous thing to look upon? Or
will he be, as Edmond Perrler, director of
the Museum of the Jardlne des Plantes
and constructor of the first picture of the
Martian, describes him? The French
scholar held that the Martian bears a certain
resemblance to man, although many

The Spider's N
THE Field Museum in Chicago once
became infested with a large
number of obnoxious spiders.
They feBtooned the celling and great columns
of the building with yards of their
shuttle work. Scrubwomen and Janitors
tried in vain to rid the building of the
pests and their work. Finally a small
bird, known as the brown creeper, discovered
the state of things and decided
to take up its abode inside and Rssist the
authorities in ridding the building of the
pestB. I
For several days the bird flitted about
very much as it pleased, wagging up and 1
down column after column and probing 1
its bill into every crevice, and he actually
carried on a very effective work. i
One morning, however, as an official i
of the museum was passing, an attendant 1
remarked to him that it looked very much i
as if the bird were done for, and a subject
for the museum's collection. Olanc- I

He has further stated that the Martians
live in an intellectual Utopia?a Utopia
that is all the name implies.
Prof. Lowell, director of the observatory
at Flagstaff, Ariz., and one of the
greatest authorities on Mars, places the
Martian people on a much higher intellectual
plane than those on earth.
"Quite possibly," Prof. Lowell has written,
"the Martian folk are possessed of inventions
of which we have not dreamed,
and with them electrophones and kinetoscopes
are things of a bygone past, preserved
with the veneration in the museums
as relics of the clumsy contrivances
of the simple childhood of the race.
"Certainly what we see hints at the existence
of beings who are in advance of *
not behind us in the journey of life."
The canal system of Mars indicates that
the planet's inhabitants' are a race of
super-engineers. If they outshine us men- '
tally as much as Prof. Lowell claims, we
can expect to find that our "modern" and
much boasted of buildings are as the
tepees of the Sioux, our engineering
works no further advanced than the
dams of the beaver, our inventions as
9lmple as children's toys.

tendant the officer saw that the bird lay
panting on Its side at the bottom of one
of the columns.
"Catch a fly," said the scientist to his
attendant, as he took the bird into his
hands. The fly soon being forthcoming,
it was held on the point of a pin to the
bird's beak, and to the surprise of both
men the creeper bit at it voraciously.
That didn't look as If the little fellow
were about to die. The scientist was
much perplexed and wondered what was
the matter with the bird.
Then, turning the bird over in his hand,
lie found it had been entrapped In a
arge spider's web, which had bound the
wing and tail together In such a manner
as to preclude flying. It looked as if
jome old, wise spider had resented the
bird's work of extermination and had
purposely ensnnred him in a trap.
The queer bandage was removed and
;he bird darted out of the building and
was soon lost to Bight.

IBH Ok? of Existence
How the Telescopes
on Earth Showed the
Firing of the Projec
tile* in Which the
First Invaders from
Mars Were Shot Out Into Space.
By Dr. W. H. Ballou.
THE reports of the leading astrono
mers show that the condition! of
life on the planet Mart at the pres
ent moment are becoming increasingly
hard and that if the planet is inhabited,
as appears probable, its people must now
be seeking some way of escape from their
miseries.
We are therefore confronted by the
possibility that has often been discussed
'>y imaginative scientists and others?a
descent upon the earth by the inhabitants
of Mars. Professor I/Owell, Professor
Pickering, Camille Flammarion and other
scientists, as well as H. G. Wells, have
pointed out that if the means of life were
failing on any planet it was logical to
expect the inhabitants would try to move
to some other planet. The only
question is how they would
move, und Mr. Wells may have
solved that problem.
Mart at the present moment
r>T?-rs unusual opportunities for
observation to the astronomer, as
it is nearer to the earth than it
!i;ts V?een for many ypars. It is
mow only 42,350,000 miles away,
"hereas at this time last year It
vas 200.000,000 miles away!
Two years from now Mars will
l-e only 34.P00.000 miles away.
If they cannot attack us
this year, the Martians,
having suffered unbear
able miseries, will, per
haps, have perfected their
arrangements in the two
year period and may then
descend upon the earth in
devastating myriads.
Summer on Mars has now passed, and
even ordinary telescopes show that the
ice and snow cap around the poles of
Mars have spread further than ever, add
ing to the hardships of life on an ordi
narily cold and arid planet.
There is ample scientific evidence for
conjecturing that life on Mars has now
become a long agony which no earthly
creature could endure, and which even the
Martians, who have undergone ages of
adaptation, are finding unbearable.
Incessantly swept by terrible dust
storms, unable to find sufficient nourish
ment on an arid, froten globe, gasping
for breath in an exhausted atmosphere,
unable to find even water, the Martians
are living in an inferno that only the pen
of a Dante could describe.
All the evidence indicates that the Mar
tians must soon make a wholesale migra
tion to the earth or some other favorable
planet in the manner that imaginative
writers have suggested. Unless they do
so, they are faced with speedy annihila
tion.
This tragic situation lends great inter
est to the new illustrations Jnade by a
brilliant European artist, Alvim Correa,
for a French edition of H. G. Wells "War
of the Worlds." It will be remembered
that in this famous work the Martians,
luing threatened with extinction, brcan
shooting themselves to the earth in vast
numbers.
They were all brain and no bones and
shaped much like giant octopuses. To
compensate for the lack of skeleton, their
bodies were enclosed in circular metal
cases and moved on enormous metal stilts
They nourished themselves on Mars by
transfusing blood from the bodies of man
like creatures. When they reached earth
they used men for food purposes and
were rapidly destroying the helpless popu
lation. They rapidly conquered London
and other important regions.
But on Mars the Martians had liv#d
entirely without disease germs and con
sequently possessed no acquired immunity
to them. With the blood of human beings
they drew in the germs of death and
rapidly succumbed without a struggle.
They had command of a burning ray,
which instantly shrivelled up any object
which it touchcd. ?
When the Martian invaders needed
food they picked up human beings in their
long tentacles, transferred their blood to
themselves and threw their empty car

no such , weapon was in existence when

happened after Wells wrote his book, ar

trenches or moving obiaets. I? other
words, it was only effective against built

"All that is cha'.jred now. The French

seas to diversify its topography. More
, than one-half of Mars is a dreary desert,
and the rest is green only when the canals
are bringing water from the Polar ice
capa. He first described the great dust
rtorms which sweep over its equatorial
section, blotting out hundreds of square
miles of the planets surface from our
view.
The physical conditions on Mars are
very different from those we have on
earth. The force of gravity exerted on
Mars is only three-eighths of that on. the
earth, while the atmospheric pressure that
is about fifteen pounds to the square inch
at sea level on earth is less than fo*ur
pounds on Mars. This would make it
possible for enormous weights to be lifted
on Mars with. little muscular effort, as
compared with the tasks on our planet.
Lowell figured that Martians could do
seven times more work than human beings
on earth with the same amount of effort.
An elephant could leap like a gatelle
there, and a stone thrown into the air
would go very high and sink with a slow,
graceful motion, much like the apparent
action of a slowed-up movie camera.
The supposed signals from Mars, which
Marconi believed he had received on his
yacht Electra this Summer, may well have
something to do with distress on that
planet, although a different explanation
of them has been furnished.
It is commonly assumed that the Mar
tian, if he exists at all, has a much older
civilization than our own. The basis for
this assumption is the nebular hypothesis,
according to which the various planets
were thrown off in succession from the
mass of world-stuff which contracted as
it cooled, with the sun at its centre. On
this thesis thfe outer planets would ob
viously be older and Mars would presum
ably have been far ahead of us in de
veloping a living population.
We might fairly expect our elder plan
etary brother to take the initiative in
sending signals to the earth. Radio,
which is new with us, may bo an old, old
story with the Martians. Quite possibly
they have been patiently waiting thou
sands of years for us to become intellir.
gent enough to answer their signals.
If the Martian exists, and if he has a
radio system that can reach the earth, ho
should have no difficulty in revealing him
self to us. Nothing more itrould be neces
sary than to send a series of signals at
fixed intervals. If. for example, ne were
to make two ?ipnsls, then after an inter
val two more, and after a doable interval,
four signals, we should know that he was ;
proving that he could add two and two.

	<text>Search for Life Urged
In Exploration of Space
By FRANK CAREY
A«ioclat«l Preu Science Writer
A group of 100 top-ranking
American scientists urged the
Government yesterday to place
more emphasis on searching
for life beyond the earth.
They cited international
prestige as one consideration,
and voiced concern that life
detection experiments might
not be ready in time for in
clusion in the first unmanned
capsule landing on Mars. This
is scheduled to take place
sometime in 1966.
The scientists expressed some
criticism of the man-in-space
program. They said not enough
emphasis is being put on de
veloping techniques to sustain
astronauts on prolonged flights
such as those to the moon
and the planets.
Among other things, the
group called for inclusion of
a microphone in the first un
manned Martian capsule in
order to record the swish of
any plants waving in the
Martian winds and the sounds
of any creatures that might be
on the prowl.

	<text>The greatest possible commotion pre
vailed. The entire world was interested.
Scientists from every country flocked to the
seat of the new observatory. The great
telescope, the marvel of the nineteenth cen
tury, was the talk of two continents.
'this world was on the eve of communicat
ing with Mars. It had been scientifically
roved possible. Astronomers watching the
istant planet through lesser telescopes had
observed the attempts of the Martians to sig
nal us. They were using a system of great
planes and geometrical figures which formed
themselves into an unaerstanuaoie coae.
Slowly was the big telescope focused on
the distant star. Distracted reporters
dashed around sending bulletins every five
minutes. Aged astronomers waited with
trembling anxiety for the great moment of
their lives. Hundreds of smaller telescopes
were carired along the range of the new op
tical instrument.
"The Martians are signaling! " telegraphed
an excited correspondent; "in a few min
utes more the signals will be read." At last!
An eajjer eye is glued to tiie glass. The
great figures on the plains oi .Mars move
slowly. The world is hushed waiting for the
message, the first to break the silence o'
Aeons. The first letter is made out with
difficulty: the others follow more rapidly.
The aged scientist spells out: "K-U-B-B-K-RT"-rtubber!-Puek.

	<text>Red Planet
By EDWIN ROLFE
Red planet, hanging low over metal-tinted walls:
Move a bit in the sky so the color-starved masses may see you,
Leap, suddenly, from a bleak year into the next;
Red planet, over the gray walls built of the burnt ashes of blood. v
There are a thousand such walls, red planet, on the earth,
Built by fat ants who fear the dazzling message of your color.
I have watched these fattened ants for a thousand years, i - ed planet,
And my father before me has watched them a thousand more.
The ants have been building these walls since you first were seen in the
skies,
Using the ashes of blood to block the sight of you.
Each time you rise, red planet, you are a little higher,
And a little nearer to us, the masses imprisoned in walls.
Your red is a little brighter, its color-shafts pierce our walls.
(That is why the fattened ants continually build them higher,
Building wall upon wall with the burnt ashes of our blood.)
Thinking they can stop your progress by their puny efforts,
But someday, red planet, you will have attained
A spot so high in the heavens, so gleaming bright in the heavens,
That the ants will shriek with confusion, and hide themselves in their
holes,
And the masses will rise from their earth-fetters, rise from a thousand
hells,
As the walls of the burnt blood ars shattered
By the impact of your light.

much of the pleasant sightliness of the

	<text>A GAME FOR ALL SEASONS.
It Is Called "liadiulnton" ud Cuuie From
England.
Badminton was invented, or origin
ated, whichever you please, in England,
but owes its present rules to the Ah
medabad Badminton club of India,
Which has practically revived the sport.
It is a modification of lawn tennis, with
some important differences, as will be
seen further on, and has the advantage
that it can be, and generally is, played
in-doors. This make3 it both a suramet
and winter game.
Tho dimensions of the court must be
decided in a great measure by the capa
bilities of the room in which the game
is played. Tho best size Is one twenty
eight feet long by twenty feet broad.
The courts should bo marked off by
means of pegs and strings, or better,
when possible, by white chalk lines oe
the floor, and divided in the following
way: At each end ol the ground are
two courts, ten feet square, while the
center is formed by a piece of neutral
ground eight feet broad by twenty feet
long. On each of these outer lines of
the neutral ground and in the center
are placed tho posts which support tho
net The net, which is two feet to two
feet six inches deep, is suspended at a
height of six feet from the ground, and
firmly held by guy ropes attached to
posts.
The racquets used in Badminton, to
be easily and quickly Wielded, should
be lighter than those used in lawn ten
nis, and consequently smaller. A shut
tlecock is used instead of a ball, and
may be large or small, according to tho
wish of the players.
In its general line, Badminton is a
game played in the same fashion as
lawn tennis, with tho exception that
from one to four persons may play on a
side, and that tho shuttlecock must be
returned on the volley. Tho shuttle
cock is served and returned under tho
same provisions, except that, of course,
if the shuttlecock falls on the ground,
it Is counted as a miss to the player
missing it, and to his side. The servico
shall be from the "service-corner," tho
server and receiver each standing with
both feet within their respective quad
rants until the shuttlecock is struck.
The divisions of the respective courts
are only observed in the serve or first
hit; after that, the partners may stand
where they please, on their side of tha
net The shuttlecock must be served
in such a way that it falls clear over the
net, without touching the net, ropes or
posts, and falls inside the lines of the
service-court If the net Is touched in
service and tho shuttlecock falls over,
the stroke is considered as a "let," and
does not count as a fault against the
person serving. In play, however, the
touching of the net by the shuttlecock,
when it falls over, is counted as good
stroke. If the net is touched by the
racquets of the players, or if they reach
over the net with their racquets, tho
stroke counts against them. Two faults
puts "hand out" In all cases a shuttle
Cock falling on any of the boundary
lines Is regarded as a fault, as if it had
fallen outside Of the boundary lines,
both in service and play.
Iifteen points constitute the game.
In service no overhand stroke is allow
ed. The shuttlecock is judged by where
it strikes and not by where it lies after
striking. In judging whether a player
has reached over tho net, the umpire
should bo careful to note if the shuttle
cock Is struck before it has crossed the
net and not by the racquet of the play
or, which is naturally carried forward
by the impetus of the stroke and which
might arrive at a slight angle over the
net, although the shuttlecock itself was
struck on the correct side. If, however,
the net is touched by the racquet the
stroke counts against the player, wheth
er the shuttlecock was struck on the
right side of the net or not
As will be seen from the description,
Badminton requires agility and a quick
eye, rather than great strength, and it
will be found to be a game at which
girls can play with pleasure and profit

badminton Has Not Driven
Tennis From Favor.
BOSSIP OF THE CHAMPIONS.
I y Mabel Cahill, the John L. Sullivan
•f the Xew York Club, and Other
i Great Flayers.

i jriw YORK. May 25.—[Special Corre
' jpoodence.J—The tennis season of 1891 has
fairly begun, and from present appear
ances it will be the liveliest one that has
aver been known in this country. There
was a prospect earlier in the season that
badminton might supplant the older game
in favor, but every one concerned now
scouts the possibility of such a result. No
one, naturally, takes a keener interest in
the question than the makers of tennis
goods, and they report the largest advance
tale* on record. It is one of the not to be
forgotten consequences of the popularity
of lawn tennis that the manufacture and
nleof neta, rackets, lawn markers, shoes
and uniforms has become a great industry.
It is only a few years since all these goods
were imported from England, the home of
fee game; now they are practically all
Bade here, and th» business amounts to
something like $10,000,000 a year to the
trade. This is looking at the other side of
the sport, but the point of view is not an
unimportant one.
The clubs in and about New York are in
nnmfctr almost legion, and they are pre
paring busily for championship events,
mcticaliy the season begins with Decora
tion day, the month of fine weather before
that date being given np to practice play
ing. Of course, play begins earlier South.
The Washington City tournament for the
championship of the Southern states was
held in the middle of May. Tomorrow
the New York Tennis Club will hold its
spring games, and from now to the end of
the season in October there will be a
tournament every day—for not a summer
hotel of any size is without its tennis
courts, the smaJlest villages have their
clubs, and matches and return matches
t are shrewdly relied upon to keep up the
interest in the game.
Undoubtedly the success of tennis is
OLLIE CA MPBELL.
largely due to the fact that men and
women can play it together. For flirta
tion purposes it may not quite eoual the
sedate and sluggish game of croquet,
but for a judicious combination of
sport and opportunities for tete-a-tetes
its equal has never been invented.
Indeed, tennis is the ideal ladies' game.
As it requires agility rather than strength
to play tennis, there is no reason why
women should not play quite as well as
men, if it were not for the perpetual haudi
cap ot skirts. As it is, an active young
woman is about a match for a stout and
middle-aped man, with equal practice, and
some of the l>est women players can hold
their own with any but the very best men.
i his is a test not to be recommended,how
ever, as the practice of playing with one of
the other sex rather tends to break a man
up. as he is divided between his gallantry
and his desire to excel. Thus it may easily
happen that a man will show tip in better
form at the end of a season with compara
tively little practice with men than if he
had considerable careless playing with
women. Championship games are, of
course, always between players of the
•tne sex.
•Since Scars, of Boston, who was an ex
fi.rdinary tennis player, met with a dis
cing accident, the honors of the game
Jwe rested with the Brooklyn players
Henry \V. Stocum, jr., son of General ll!
W. Slocum, the champion of iw, and Oli
"Ollie" Campbell, the present
bolder ot the championship, both having
park in past years,
though Mr. Slocum is ;IOR a member of
P:. George's Club, of New York. There is
perhaps no place in the country where bet
ter provision is made for tennis playing on
| » large scale than at Prospect park, and
■ „ there are few days in spring or summer
when a considerable number of games are
lot going on there simultaneously.
The frequency of va ant lots in the resU
yace sections of Brooklyn rather favors

Miw Ballantine, of the New York club.
Miss Robinson, of Staten Island,
Mrs Morgan, of Short Hill*. N. J.,
the Misses Kiting. Frazer and Temple, of
Westchester county, and Miss Colby, of
Orange, N. J., are among the famous play
ers who may contert for the honors with
Miss< ah:i! and the Roosevelt sisters. Of
course, there will be dark horses, too, who
at the last moment mav appear to wrest
the leadership away from the well-known
plavers. It is always more difficult to
predict women's piaying than men's.
They have more time for practice, they
are quite as numerous, if not more so. and
they are far less likely to enter champion
ship contests than men, even if quite pro
ficient. Thus local pride may almost at
any time force to the front some splendid
player before unheard of outside of her
county. It is the peculiarity of the plav
ers of both sexes that they are at their
best while quite young and do jiotlong
retain their supremacy.
Badminton came to the front last winter
as an indoors game, for which it was well
adapted by the smallness of the court re
quired. A tennis court is 78 feet by 27
wider than an ordinary city lot and nearly
as deep. The badminton court is only 44
feet by 20, and can be recommended for a
home game where spare is verv limited.
The net is shorter and higher. The short
service line is 6 feet 6 inches from the net.
The base line is 15 feet t> inches farther
back on either side. The net itself is 16
feet long and 5 feet high in the middle.
In the play a shuttlecock is used in
stead of the white ball used in ten
nis. This is made of rubber and
feathered to steady its light. Ordinary
tennis rackets are used instead of the ola
faehioned "battledores." The game is, in
fact, a sort of cross between lawn tennis
and the older game, and is said to be the
invention of an English officer in India,
who found the climate too hot for ten
nis. Perhaps that is the reason why old
tennis players call badminton a lazy peo-
Sle's When such sturdy at hletes as
[amihon Cary and .Stanley Mortimer and
such clever tennis experts as Miss Annie
Webb, Miss Turnure, Miss Minturn and
Miss Elsie Mitchell play and enjoy ths
game, however, it can safely he assumed
that, there is plenty of exercise in it.
The rules of badminton are so simple
that they can be summarized in a para
graph. There is no authoritative Ameri
can body like the National Tennis Associ
ation, but the English rules are used:
The sides toss for choiceof ends or service
before the first game of a match, and change
to the other sideof the netafter each game.
The single-handed and double-handed
game consists of fifteen ares. At "13 all,"
the side which first reaches thirteen has
the option of "setting^'five; at 14 all, of
setting three. In three-handed or four-
handed jrames the game consists of twenty
one aces. First set is at 19 all; second at
20 all. A fault made by a player whose
I side is in puts a baud out; if made by a
j player whose side is out it counts an afe to
i the in side. It is a fault if the service is
I "overhand"; if the rirs-t part of the path of
: the shuttlecock is inclined downward ;if the
' service falls into the wrong court; if the ser
! vice falls short of the service line or outside
the bounding line; unless both the server's
teet are in his own court; if the shuttle
cock falls outside the bounds of the court;
if the shuttlecock does not pass between
the posts, or if it pass under or through
tiie net or touch anything except the bat
of the striker, or the top of the net ; if the
shuttlecock !e hit twice intentionally by
tiie same player; if the shuttlecock be
! struck before it crosses the striker's side of
i the net; if the striker touch the net or its
supports with his racket or otherwise,
i The player in the right-hand court com
! mencea the game by serving to the plaver
' in the adverse right-hand oourt; if tfiat
leaver return the shuttlecock, it must be
; hit : ack by the in side and then returned
by the out side till a fault is made by one
j side or the other. The game is continued
, in this manner, count being chanced after
j each ace ;s made. The service lines nre
disregarded alter the serve is returned,
j Iho innings always begin with the player
j in the right-hand court, and serves arc
i made alternately from each court into the
one d. t.; iia.lv opposite. In two. three
and tour-handed games, the side begin
ning a game has only one hand in its nrst
innings if there are two a side, and only
two hands if there are three a side. Inatwo
h and el game only the ptrson served to may
take a serve; not so in a three or four
handed game. The service must not begin
till the opponent is ready, but any attempt
to return is taken to indicate readiness.
Any unforseen or accidental hindrance
may be given by a "let" bv the umpire on
appeal from either side "before the next
service commences or before the players
have changed sides at the end of a game.
A "let" cannot be claimed it" an attempt
I ha* been made to strike the shuttlecock
Pitiably the next winter there will be a
! badminton association iu this country r or
the new game may he taken under the
l government of the tennis association.

In play, however, the touching of the net

players, or if they reach over the ne£_ with
their racquets, the stroke counts against

Two faultf puts "hand out." In all cases
a shuttlecock falling on any of the boundary
lines is regarded as a fault, as if it had fallen
outside of the boundary lines, both in service
and play.
Fifteen points constitute the game. In ser
vice no overhand stroke is allowed.
The shuttlecock is judged by where it strikes
and not by where it lies after striking.
In judging whether a player has reached
ever the net, the umpire should be careful to
note if the shuttlecock is struck before it
has crossed the net and not by the racquet of
the player, which is naturally carried forward
by the impetus of the stroke and which might
arrive at a slight angle over the net. although
the -shuttlecock itself was struck fairly on the
correct side.
If, however, the net is touched by the
racquet the stroke counts against the player,
whether the shuttlecock was struck on the
right side of the net or not.
As will be st%n from the description, Bad
minton requires agility and a quick eye, rather
than great strength, and it will be found to
be a game at which girls can play with pleas
ure and profit.'

	<text>Davidson has played before 8,000,000 — probably an all-time record
It looks easy when Ken Davidson, international badminton
star, clips the bird over the net. But it isn't. That's why
the game is fun ... why it's America's fastest*growing sport
by Bob Gakn
Big Bill Tilden threw his racket on the
court, wobbled to the sideline, slumped
disgustedly on a bench. It wasn’t merely'
losing a match to that clown on the other side
of the net; what especially wounded the pride
of the court veteran was that he had failed
to score even one point.
England’s great tennis teacher, Danny
Maskell, sat down beside Tilden. ‘‘Looks like
you'll have to take back what you said about
badminton being a sissy sport, Bill. But cheer
up. That fellow Davidson is the best badmin
ton player in the world. And you could prob
ably beat him just as badly on a tennis
court.”
Tilden’s undoing was his own fault. He
had seen the international badminton exhi
bitionist, Ken Davidson, in a performance at
the London Palladium. Davidson made the
shuttle sport look so easy that Tilden chal
lenged him to a game. With his years of court
experience and racket technique Tilden felt
he could give Davidson a close contest.
The badminton match was arranged and
Tilden was confident as tie took his position
to start serving the shuttlecock. The tennis
master hit a high serve and Davidson re
turned a towering “clear,” or lob. Big Bill
prepared to smash the one-sixth ounce of
feathers and cork with all the power of his
famous cannonball serve. He connected
squarely and the feathered bird zoomed
past Davidson. The badminton expert calmly
made a backhand stab, catching the shuttle
just before it hit the floor, and returned a
soft drop shot.
With a ‘ how’d he ever get that one?” look.
Bill scrambled to the net and managed to re
trieve the shuttlecock. Davidson then pro
ceeded to clear over Tildens head. The ten
nis giant turned and sprinted to back court
and again got his racket on the bird in time
to return a weak shot. Davidson, now at the
net, cut it off with another drop shot and
grinned as Tilden helplessly watched the
shuttlecock flutter to the floor.
Complete Shut-out
The succeeding points were similar, David
son not trying to make aces, just keeping
Tilden on the run. Final score-Davidson,
15, Tilden, 0.
You may never have heard of Ken David
son. Yet during the last ten years his audience
has numbered almost 8,000,000, an attend
ance record challenging that of any individual
athletic performer in history.
Ken Davidson has shown his feather
manipulating prowess to King George VI in
a command performance and to East Side
tenement kids; to Park Avenue millionaires
and shoppers at Macys; to the elite at the
Rainbow Room and the gang at the Roxy —
and he has always had the same enthusiastic
reception.
If you can imagine a combination of trick
shot golfer Joe Kirkwood, baseball clown A1
Schacht and tennis screwball Frank Kovacs,
you have a good description of badminton
showman Ken Davidson. No matter how im
portant a match may be, or how close, he
insists on having his fun. And hell try a trick
shot now and then, even though it may
mean losing the point. He can do things with
a shuttlecock that are almost unbelievable,
such as completely missing an overhead
smash, then bringing his racket up from the
floor on the follow-through to hit the bird
safely across the net — to the bewilderment
of an opponent.
He can take ten shuttlecocks, hit each one
in a high, graceful arc, and have them all
drop within a radius of one square foot at
the extreme opposite end of a court, forty
four feet away.
As a British amateur, Davidson won vir
tually every major badminton title in Great
Britain and Continental Europe. Then in
1935 he made a decision that established him
in a career. He decided to go to unconverted
America — a land of badminton opportunity.
At first Davidson played in American tour
naments. He defeated the best United States
player, Walter Kramer, of Detroit, 15-6,
15-13 in one tournament, and 15-1 in an ex
hibition match.
The next year Davidson turned professional
and went on a nation-wide tour giving exhi
bitions at clubs, stores and schools.
Badminton was just starting to bud in
this country. By the time Davidson finished
his tour it was in full bloom. The feather mer
chant made it look so easy and entertaining
that people went home and began hitting a
shuttlecock in their back yards.
Davidsons first fame in America came in
an exhibition before 19,000 spectators at
Madison Square Garden. He next took his
act to the Rainbow Room in Radio City.
Every night after the exhibition the shuttle
master issued an open challenge to any of
the dine-and-dancers. A bottle of champagne
was offered to the person who could defeat
Davidson in a nine-point game, each chal
lenger starting with five points already
scored. Many of the socialites accepted the
challenge, but the champagne remained on
ice.

	<text>Badminton
The name badminton was ‘“‘poo
na’”’ when first played in India, no
one knows how long ago. English
soldiers on leave carried it home
and it was introduced by the Duke
of Beaufort at his home, Badmin
ton. Hence the name. Like tennis,
it is played with rackets, but on a
smaller court. Instead of a ball, a
shuttlecock is used. This is shaped
like an orange cut in half, has feath
ers imbedded in the flat side. The
shuttlecock must be hit on the round
side and while in the air.

	<text>BATTLEDORE AND SHUTTLECOCK.
New Summer Game to be Played lu a
Grassy Court bike Tennis.
The g'arden game of the summer will
be battledore and shuttlecock, played
out of doors.
The game is carried on with balls and
rackets, which are “battledore” and
“shuttlecock.”
It is played in a square court, across
the middle of which a very low netting
is stretched. The court can be any size
agreable to both “teams,” and the deci
sion of size must depend upon the agil
ity of the players. A court forty feet
square is large enough for beginners,
but those who have practiced and be
come very quick on their feet can play
in one a hundred feet square with no
difficulty.
The exact dimensions must bo decided
by the players, and the court outlined
by a rope or wire running from four
posts that bound the court.
The netting is not over a foot high;
beginners play with a six-inch net. It
must be low enough for the players to
jump it easily at certain stages in the
game.
Tlie Game.
The game is begun by “dore,” or um
pire. She stands in the middle of the net
and tosses the shuttlecock or ball to the
side which is to begin.
It is played by eight persons, four on
each side. Two rest and two play. The
two players continue until they have had
one round, they then seat themselves and
the other two take their places for the
second round. This gives a period of
rest and one of activity, the former be
ing more needed by the vigorous exercise
of the game. The “dore” throws the
shuttlecock towards the side which won
the last game, and at the end of each
round to the side which won the round.
It is little or no great advantage to re
ceive the shuttlecock first, because what
ever point it may give in the beginning
is neutralized before the round is over.
The player who receives the shuttle
cock from the “dore” strikes it from un
derneath and sends it over the net to the
player on the other side. The shuttle
cock cannot be struck with the end of
the battledore, but must receive a plump
blow from either side of the implement.
The “round” is given to the side who
strikes the tenth successive stroke. The
shuttlecock is kept going back and forth
as long as possible. The tenth strike con
stitutes the close of the round.
The “dore” stan Is at the net and counts
the strokes in. a loud voice. As she
nears the tenth stroke the wildest excite
ment prevails, and both sides are eager
to strike it and count out.
The Rounds.
Complications come in after the player
has struck the shuttlecock. After she hits
it a blow she can start after it, leap the
netting and strike her own shuttlecock
back to her own team. To do this she
must be very quick on her feet and very
lucky if she prevents the other side from
stopping her: if she succeeds in doing so
it counts two for her side and a foul for
the other side. These extra points are
counted separately and added up at the
close of the game. Ten of them makes an
extra round, a foul takes off two.
If a ball is struck out of the court it
counts a foul for the side who strikes
it. and if the player to whom the ball is
struck succeeds in running cut of the
court and meeting the ball, it counts
two for that side and two off for the
other side. These points are kept by the
“dore,” who adds them together, and
when ten is reached announces an extra
round for the side that has won the ex
tra points.
The blows that arc struck after the
player has leaped the net in pursuit of
her own ball do not count in the regular
round, but go in as “extras,” two be
ing counted for each successful blow.
The balls in use are the small tennis
balls and the battledore is a hollow im
plement of thin skin stretched over a
frame and provided with a long handle.
The ball is a common one, but in this
game is called either “bail” or shuttle
cock.
The “dore” keeps a score card in con
stant use, not trusting to her memory to
keep the points. Each time a player
strikes a ball, leaps the net and sends
her own ball back she calls out “two
extra,” which means that two is put
down towards an extra round in favor of
the lucky player’s team; at the same time
she calls out “two foul” for the other
side, which takes two from their extra
round. The game meanwhile progresses
on its regular way, and when ton is
struck the regular round is at an end.
Six rounds make a very good game un
less there is a time provision; in that
case two hours is a game.
Tackling.
Although battledore and shuttlecock
calls for the liveliest exercise, it is not
necessary to wear a costume, as “tack
ling” is not allowed. The players can
dress in garden gowns of conventional
walking length.
In pursuing the ball on the other side
of the net. when the opposite team is
trying to prevent the players from strik
ing it, all iuterferenc must be done
with the battledore; no personal force
can be used, but the payers can leap in
the air or in any other way try to reach
the ball. After it has been struck they
cannot stop it with their uplifted battle
dore to prevent it from crossing the net.
The “dore,” while this is going on.
watches it closely to see if a foul is
struck. If the ball is struck with the end
of the battledore it is a foul.
This game can be very nicely played
upon a lawn which has not many trees,
and is an excellent summer game, be
cause of the possibilities of pretty gowns
and graceful moves. It is not difficult to
learn, and battledore and shuttlecock will
be as popular this summer as it was
years ago, in the days when it was played
indoors, as the only graceful and lady
like game that could be played by wom
en. Harry Germaine.

	<text>SPORTS or COUSIN JOHN CHINAMAN.
The Chinaman is so tremendously hard
working that it Is difficult to Imagine
when he finds time for games. But, like
everyone else, he has an occasional holi
day, about twenty In the year, and on
these occasions he goes in for games with
much vigor.
There Is hardly a game we play our^
selves that you cannot find a counter
part of in China. Indeed, many of our
garnies such as football, battledore and
shuttlecock, Chess and backgammon, we
owe directly to Chinese inventiveness.
•Shuttlecock, though played in Japan with
a 'battledore, is played by Chinese coolies
with their feet. The shuttlecock, called
literally "Chicken Feather Swallow," Is
made of several pieces of snake skin,
about an Inch and a half In diameter,
weighted out with a copper coin, and
having a few feathers roughly stuck in
the top. This and a similar game with
